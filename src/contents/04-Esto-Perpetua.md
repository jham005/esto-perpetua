title: Esto Perpetua, Carron Co.'s motto, to live forever
---

Esto Perpetua, it seems a rather grandiose claim that Carron Company should adopt as its motto to live forever in 1773. It was a fashion then to use Latin mottos, James Watt used 'Ingenio et Labore' which complements Carron Co. as both achievers have not been forgotten. James Watt did also develop his early experiments on the steam engine at Carron Co. in the 1760s. Cast iron has an inbuilt longevity being inherently rust resistant, it should last a very long time, other reasons than longevity ensure its abandonment e.g., fashion, accumulated age patina, light weight alternatives etc.

According to chef legend cast iron has unique cooking properties, a seasoned non-stick surface created by cooking oil use over many years; the way heat spreads evenly across the pan enables uniform cooking. Both adds the mystery ingredient 'taste'.  Its likely that a Carron Co. made cast iron pan would survive til today, as it would not have worn out and be passed down the generations like a pancake & bannock girdle. However what we have in the Ironheart frypan is something that in theory will last forever.
