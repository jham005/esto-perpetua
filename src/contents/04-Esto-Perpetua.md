title: Esto Perpetua, Carron Co.'s motto, to live forever
---

Esto Perpetua, it seems a rather grandiose claim that Carron Company should adopt as its motto to live forever in 1773. It was a fashion then to use Latin mottos, James Watt used 'Ingenio et Labore' which complements Carron Co. as both achievers have not been forgotten. James Watt did also develop his early experiments on the steam engine at Carron Co. in the 1760s. Cast iron has an inbuilt longevity being inherently rust resistant, it should last a very long time, other reasons than longevity ensure its abandonment e.g., fashion, accumulated age patina, light weight alternatives etc.
According to cook legend cast iron has unique cooking properties, a seasoned non-stick surface created by cooking oil use over many years; the way heat spreads evenly across the pan enables uniform cooking. Both adds the mystery ingredient 'taste'.  Its likely that an Ironheart made cast iron pan could survive, as it would not have worn out and be passed down the generations like a pancake & bannock girdle. The Ironheart frypan is in theory something that in theory will last forever.

Allied Ironfounders badge post 1940 most likely designed by the world famous Raymond Loewy design studio, which also redesigned the Otto & Apollo room heating stoves and the AGA cooker from 1937. The revolutionary Rayburn solid fuel heat storage cooker introduced in 1946 was also designed by Loewy Associates.

Allied ironfounders grew out of the Light castings group of 1922 composed of two Falkirk foundries McDowall Steven & Co. and Malcolm Cockburn's Gowanbank foundry with the Manchester based Planet Foundry and the Shrops based Coalbrookdale foundry. In 1929 this expanded to include 12 foundries six in the Falkirk area. A new AI HQ was built in Graham's Rd., Falkirk, in 1938. AI was sold to Glywed in 1969.

Glywed. A metals combine which sold off all the AI Falkirk area foundries. Renamed AGA Foodservice in 2001. Only local remaining former AI brand is Falcon Foodservice who make Kitchen equipment cookers, fryers, ovens etc. Based in the former Wang factory Causewayhead, by Stirling University.
