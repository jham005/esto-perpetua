Welcome to the Ironheart website: Falkirk Made Cast Iron Frypans, bathtubs, Robert Burns Heads and Ironhearts storybook...

![Ironheart and the Ironhearts of Irontown](Ironhearts.jpg)

This website has the aim of promoting the achievements of 'Ironheart' and stimulating interest in an industry which still has a purpose. The cast iron artifacts and booklet are ways to promote Ironheart and engage in practical ways to raise funds for campaigns by Falkirk Made Friends (FMF).

'Ironheart' is the collective term  for the achievements of the Falkirk area foundries and their International influence. A term created by Falkirk Made Friends to unite the many solid achievements - and the contribution to enabling new standards public health - of the some sixty plus Falkirk area foundries. The cast iron frying pan was one of the earliest products made in the Falkirk area by Carron Co., 1759-1982. The almost immediate consequence was to find a better way of using the frypan more efficiently, which led to the development from the open fire to the kitchen range cooker. Consequently, Ironheart would become a national and International hub turning up the heat on cooker innovation.

The poet Robert Burns was born the same year as Carron Co.,1759, and he lived through the rise of the foundry and interacted with it on many occasions. The maker of the Robert Burns wall sculptures is unknown at present but they are a solid Ironheart way of celebrating the Burns connections. Tam and Souter Johnnie are two characters from Burns narrative poem Tam O'Shanter, which has its origin by the heat of a revolutionary Carron Co. kitchen range (see Short video of part of the play on Tam). The mini bath tubs were sample models made by Cockburn's foundry for use by salesmen c1930s, originally coated in different colour shades of porcelain enamel. The Ironhearts of irontown storybook is an alternative way to tell of the achievements of Ironheart published in 2024. Information on how to order any of these artifacts can be found on the last page.

## 'Ironheart' What Does It Mean:

Carron Co. was the first Ironheart foundry - one of the first planned modern large scale foundry in the world Industrial Revolution - and would, as it was an innovative force of new technology, be the source of many generations of highly skilled, ambitious and motivated engineers who would both turn the Falkirk area into a world respected hub of innovative light cast iron products and educate and inspire foundry skills throughout the world. Although Carron Co recruited its first ironfounders from Coalbrookdale it's large and planned scale signalled the start of a new ambitious and energetic stage in the Industrial revolution. Becoming itself a source of highly skilled and entrepreneuring skilled ironfounders who led Northern European countries to establish iron foundries and other engineering projects, see online article Carron Co. & Eastern Europe by Geoff Bailey by Falkirk Local History club. Later, a world wide influence, e.g. Sir Robert Gibson 1863-1934 - who continued the Ironheart tradition by making the unusual top burner Lux solid fuel cooker - in Melbourne, Australia. Sir Robert turned up the heat in another way as he also gained public notoriety for his cast iron will power as chairman of the National Bank of Australia during the 1930s economic depression, criticised for his independent attitude to public spending by both polticians and the press, a particular favourite theme of cartoonists.

The recent birth of the concept of 'Ironheart' focussed the  activities of Falkirk Made Friends on the realisiation that the Falkirk area was an iron treasure trove of achievements, which transformed public health and domestic living conditions. Added to Carron Co's 'Esto Perpetua motto'; 'To Live Forever', is Falkirk Iron Co's 'Ferro Non Auro Mollescere Secula'; 'Iron, not gold, is the great civiliser'. These influenced an updated motto for FMF: 'Iron Is Falkirk's Gold'. A phrase that should encourage consideration that iron has an enduring quality for civilisation as valuable as gold.        

## How it began

FMF is a volunteer campaigning group founded in 2019 to save three K6 (made 1935-68) phone kiosks from removal by BT in 2019/20. At this time FMF had a general impression that the kiosks had been made in Falkirk by Carron Company but with no clear understanding of their history, but this was to change. The earliest discovery was a revelation: Found buried in the BT/GPO archives was that Carron Co. won the first ever GPO tender to supply 500 K2 phone kiosks on 28.1.1927, and would be the only foundry to make all four cast iron telephone kiosks, the K2,K4,K6 & K8. The story about the design of the telephone kiosk is well written about, but not the significance of its iron origins and its public role. Knowing more about this significance now, FMF argue that Falkirk can make a good case to have had a leading role in the succes of a world famous design and public service icon. 

It was also discovered that another Falkirk area foundry had won a K6 contract: McDowall Steven & Co. 1834-1964, based at the Castlelaurie foundry, in Bankside, - 1 mile from Carron Co. in Stenhouse Rd - won a GPO contract for 500 K6s c1950. Of the five known foundries that won contracts four were based in a 30 mile radius of central Scotland; Along with Carron Co. & McDowall Steven was Walter MacFarlane's Saracen foundry, 1850-1965, of Possillpark, North Glasgow and The Lion foundry in Kirkintilloch 1880-1983. The exception was the 500 made by the Warrington based Bratt Colbran company 1909-c1960. Additionally, it is an Ironheart legend that Comelybank foundry, in Broad St, Denny, made a batch of K6s in the 1980s for pre-privatised British telecom (BT).

The BT & Post Office story also continued in Ironheart because the Comelybank foundry became the works of Machan Engineering who bought 500 phone kiosks for resale. Selling restored examples to Tom Jones & Elton John. They also picked up the Post Office/Royal mail contract for cast iron lamp, wall and pillar post boxes which they made c2004-2016. The Ironheart foundries were the main maker's of post boxes: McDowall Steven & Co won a contract in 1905 continued by Allied Ironfounders (AI) until 1969. Carron Co from c1910-1982. From 1982, Andrew Mathieson of the Enginering Dept at Carron Co continued the contract under the name Carronade engineering until c1996. Robert Taylor's Larbert foundry made them for him and continued the contrcat form 1996 until closure in 2004, which is when Machan took over as it would turn out the last maker of cast iron post boxes. Although not a foundry Machan's - also an ex Carron Co foundry manager Bill McMullen - had boxes cast locally at Speciallised Castings in Denny, and Ballantine Castings in Bo'ness. Machan's also made replica Victorian era 'Penfold' pillar boxes for the Post Office/Royal Mail which were installed at heritage sites, see image. The end of the post box connection came in 2016, the loss of the post box contract also led to the closure of Machan's.

## Documenting the regeneration of the Ironheart K6s

Informed by this new realisation of the Falkirk area's rediscovered iron significance, FMF working in collaboration with the local Council saved three K6 kiosks. As their original function as a public pay phone call box is redundant new purposes had to be considered. Because of Carron's Co solid role in their history, they are now repurposed as Ironheart Time Kiosks, celebrating the many achievements of the Falkirk's area's Iron Industry with graphic displays to stimulate interest in how the innovative foundry prodcuts improved public health. 

The early campaigns of FMF were mainly about saving as many as possible of the cast iron phone kiosks in the Falkirk Council area: Dunmore, Head of Muir, Denny, Bo'ness, Dawson Park, Ladysmill, Callendar Park & King St., Stenhousemuir. However other engineering related matter were of concern, e.g. the poor condition of the Ladysmill Rail bridge, and the apparent neglect of other iron related history including: The Carron Co clock tower; the Bruce Obelisk and iron grave memorials in Larbert Old Church kirkyard, a suitable display site for the bust of Harriette Gibson 1835-1919, lead campaigner for Falkirk's first general hospital. in 1889, also ironfounder and mother of Sir Robert and William Gibson.  The rail bridge was an eyesore which only added to the general feeling of neglect around the area where the Ladysmill K6 was located. Network Rail Scotland did respond to public pressure and undertook renovation of the bridge in 2020-21, which transformed the area. Now FMF could tackle its own regeneration of the Ladysmill K6. However, at the same time, the other K6s had each a story: The Bo'ness K6 was in a conservation area and a listed so in theory a protected building, but was in poor repair. However, with the Council's conservation officer's encouragement BT did repair and repaint this Kiosk. This K6 was made by the Lion foundry in Kirkintilloch which was founded by a partnership in 1880, which included Robert Hudson a Falkirk trained ironfounder.  The Carron Co Dunmore K6 was also in a conservation area and the local community council took an interest in its protection. BT decided to retain the Head of Muir K6 (Lion foundry made). The Denny Lion K6 is in the care of the Heartbeat Trust. The Carron Co Dawson park K6 was adopted by the Bainsford War Memorial Association, now in care of the Friends of Dawson Park. This K6 is but a few hundred metres from its place of origin, Carron Co's Mungal foundry as wella s being sited in a park which was originally Carron Co property. Falkirk Council adopted under the £1 BT scheme three of the remaining K6s: Ladysmill, King St. & Callendar Park.

The Ladysmill K6 was first to get a makeover in March April 2022. Fortunately, the kiosk windows had been considerately replaced by BT just before adoption, so our main concern was with cleaning it, some minor repairs, some painting and installing a relevant graphic display which informed the public about the area from an iron perspective. These included the MacLellan's Forth bridge link, who also are involved in the origin of the Barr's soft drink Iron Bru, a Falkirk origin company. The other forgotten history was that the first general public hospital opened in 1889 in the area. The K6 had also provided a public health role by providing the 999 emergency service. These subjects were used as the basis of original drawings by Richard Duffy, a member of FMF.

The artwork on the Ladysmill K6 Leaflet can be seen on the leaflet made by Richard Duffy.

The next regeneration was the King St. Stenhousemuir K6 renamed The Tryst K6, to celebrate the role the area had as a cattle market. The opportunity to work with a local school led to some art students at Larbert High School preparing artwork for display on one side of the K6, images concerned with the Bruce Obelisk and Larbert made cooking stoves and cookers. The other two sides were

1. on the subject of the Ironhearts of Irontown story; and
2. celebrating Stenhousemuir related ironfounders.

The Tryst K6 was hit by a car in December 2022, only the wooden door was smashed but the driver did not contact FMF. A temporary repair was made and a funding application is with Falkirk Council's Community Choices scheme, 2025, which is an award scheme based on the decision of a successful council ward public vote.

![Callendar Park K6 pre-adoption condition with damaged door](TrystK6June23.jpg)

The K6 adjacent to Paterson tower shop in Callendar Park was renamed the Antonine K6 because it sits on the Roman wall, had a wind damaged broken door frame which was patched up, and the first display was made by an school art group at Graeme High School, which was on display for a year, but the artwork suffered from sun fading and weather damage. This was replaced in 2023 with a new more weatherproof perspex type graphic display created out of photographs of iron related locations in the area, plus the new Ironheart Trail maps.

The costs for the renovation of the three adopted K6s were supported by Falkirk Council Community Schools Award, the Falkirk Great Place scheme and other FMF fund raising. Solid support also came from a local company, Carron Phoenix, which had its origins in the Carron Co. sink making division.

Most Phone kiosks will have its maker's marks either inside or on the rear, sometimes both, Bratt Colbran's marks are unknown, but the most common are Carron Co. Stirlingshire or post 1975 Falkirk, & internally 'CCA'; Walter Macfarlane's Saracen foundry Glasgow, 'MFA' or 'S'; The Lion foundry Kirkintilloch, 'LFA'. McDowall steven, London & Falkirk. Internal marks unknown.

Further research revealed that Carron Co. won the first GPO phone kiosks tender in 1927, for 500 Number K2 cast iron kiosks only for installation in London. They would supply all four types of cast iron phone kiosks: the K2 1927-34, 50x K4  1930-5, K6 1935-68 & K8 1968-1982. It is an odd fact that the majority, 80,000 or so, were made by four foundries in central Scotland also including the Lion foundry Kirkintilloch, Macfarlane's Saracen foundry of Possilpark Nth Glasgow and also McDowall Steven & Co. of Falkirk, the exception being 500 K6s made in Warrington c1950. Because so many were made in the Falkirk area enough K6 scrap has been recycled to reused in the making of the Ironheart frypans.
