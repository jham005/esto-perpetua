Welcome to the Ironheart website: Falkirk Made Cast Iron Frypans, bathtubs, Robert Burns Heads and Ironhearts storybook...

This website has the purpose of promoting the achievements of Ironheart and stimulating interest in an industry which still has a purpose.

Ironheart is the collective term  for the achievements of the Falkirk area foundries and their International influence. A term coined by Falkirk Made Friends to unite the many solid achievements - and the contribution to enabling new standards public health - of the some sixty Falkirk area foundries. The cast iron frying pan was one of the earliest products made in the Falkirk area by Carron Co. from 1759. Next development was a way of using the frypan more efficiently; the kitchen range cooker. Ironheart would become a national and International hub turning up the heat on cooker innovation. The maker of the Robert Burns wall sculptures is unknown at present but they are an Ironheart way of celebrating Burns. They are two characters from Burns narrative poem Tam O'shanter. Tam and Souter Johnnie. The mini bath tubs were sample models made by Cockburn's Foundry for use by salesmen c1930s. The Ironheart storybook is an alternative way to tell of the achievements of Ironheart published in 2024. Info on how to order any of these artifacts can be found on the last page.

An explanation of the meaning of Ironheart: Carron Co. was the first Ironheart foundry - one of the first planned modern large scale foundry in the the world Industrial Revolution - and would, as it was the original innovator of new technology, be the source of many generations of highly skilled, ambitious and motivated engineers who would both turn the Falkirk area into a world hub of innovative light cast iron products and educate and inspire foundry skills throughout the world. Initially sending skilled ironfounders to assist Northern European countries to establish iron foundries and other engineering projects, see online article Carron Co. & Eastern Europe by Geoff Bailey by Falkirk Local History club. Later, a world wide influence, eg Sir Robert Gibson 1863-1934 - who continued the Ironheart tradition by making the unusual top Lux solid fuel cooker - in Melbourne, Australia.

Documenting the regeneration of the Ironheart K6s.
The recent rise of the concept of Ironheart is a consequence of the activities of Falkirk made Friends. FMF is a volunteer campaigning group founded in 2019 to save three K6 phone kiosks from removal by BT in 2019/20. At this time FMF had a general impression that the kiosks had been made in Falkirk but no clear understanding of their origin, but this was to change. In collaboration of the local Council three kiosks were saved and as their original function as a public pay phone call box is redundant they are now repurposed as Ironheart Time Kiosks, celebrating the many achievements of the Falkirk's area's Iron Industry. 
The early campaigns of FMF was mainly saving as many as possible of the cast iron phone kiosks in the Falkirk Council area: Dunmore, Head of Muir, Denny, Bo'ness, Dawson Park, Ladysmill, Callendar Park & King St, Stenhousemuir. However other engineering related matter was of concern, the poor condition of the Ladysmill Rail bridge.  This eyesore only added to the general feeling of neglect around the area where the Ladysmill K6 was located. Network Rail Scotland did respond to public pressure and then undertook renovation of the bridge in 2020-21, which began to freshen up the area. Now FMF could tackle its own regeneration of the Ladysmill K6. However, the other K6s were of concern: The Bo'ness K6 was in a conservation area and a listed so in theory a protected building, but was in poor repair. However, with Council's conservation offier's help FMF persuaded BT to repair and repaint this Kiosk. The Dunmore K6 was also in a conservation area and the local community council took an interest in its protection: BT decided to retain the Head of Muir K6: The Denny K6 is in the care of the Heartbeat Trust: The Dawson park K6 was adopted by the Bainsford War Memorial Association, now in care of the Friends of Dawson Park. Falkirk Council adopted under the Â£1.00 BT scheme three of teh K6s: Ladysmill, King St & Callendar Park.

The Ladysmill K6 was first to get a makeover in March April 20221. Fortuneately the kiosk windows had been considerately replaced by BT just before adoption

Further research revealed that Carron Co. won the first GPO phone kiosks tender in 1927, for 500 Number K2 cast iron kiosks only for installation in London. They would supply all four types of cast iron phone kiosks: the K2 1927-34, 50x K4  1930-5, K6 1935-68 & K8 1968-1982. It is an odd fact that the majority, 80,000 or so, were made by four foundries in central Scotland also including the Lion Foundry Kirkintilloch, Macfarlane's Saracen Foundry of Possilpark Nth Glasgow and also McDowall Steven & Co. of Falkirk, the exception being 500 K6s made in Warrington c1950. Because so many were made in the Falkirk area enough K6 scrap has been recycled to reused in the making of the Ironheart frypans.
