Ironheart is the collective term  for the achievements of the Falkirk area foundries and their International influence. A term coined by Falkirk Made Friends to unite the many solid achievements of the some sixty Falkirk area foundries. The cast iron frying pan was one of the earliest products made in the Falkirk area by Carron Co from 1759.
Carron Co was the first Ironheart foundry - one of the first planned modern large scale foundry in the the world Industrial Revolution - and would as it was the orinal innovator, be the source of many generations of highly skilled, ambitious and motivated engineers who would both turn the Falkirk area into a world hub of innovative light cast iron products and educate and inspire foundry skills throughout the world. 
Falkirk made Friends has its origin in a volunteer campaign to save three K6 phone kiosks from removal by BT in 2019/20. With the support of the local Council they were saved and as their original function as a public pay phone call box is redundant they are now Ironheart Time Kiosks. Further research revealed that Carron Co won the first GPO phone kiosks tender in 1927, for 500 Number K2 cast iron kiosks only for installation in London. They would supply all four types of cast iron phone kiosks: the K2 1927-34, 50x K4  1930-5, K6 1935-68 & K8 1968-1982. It is an odd fact that the majority, 80,000 or so, were made by four foundries in central Scotland also including the Lion Foundry Kirkintilloch, Macfarlane;s Saracen Foundry of Possillpark Nth Glasgow and also McDowall Steven & Co of Falkirk, the exception being 500 K6s made in Warrington c1950. Because so many were made in the Falkirk area enough K6 scrap has been recycled to reused in the making of the Ironheart frypans.
