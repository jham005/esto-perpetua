title: Falkirk 1759, start of cast iron products in Scotland with establishment of Carron Co.

Making the Ironheart frypan reconnects with the origin of Carron Company in 1759. The frying pan was one of the earliest products made at this iconoclastic foundry and lead a revolution in domestic living standards. A grand claim but one that can be explained by considering the historical context: Before the cast iron pan how did food get cooked? At its most basic food was cooked on an open fire either baked or roasted. No frying or stewing was possible unless you were wealthy enough to own a brass three legged pot - which sat in the fire.  The only other cooking aid was a bakestone. In origin a suitable stone warmed by the fire and used for making pancakes, bannocks and oatcakes. A development was the wrought iron version of the bakestone, called a girdle in Scotland, and griddle in Ireland. The reason these were passed down the generations, as heirlooms, was they were labour intensive to make, therefore expensive items. In Scotland, until the rise of Carron Co, girdle making had been a monopoly of the Culross Hammermen or Smiths confirmed by royal warrant in 1599. for further info see David Beveridge, Culross and Tulliallan, 1885, chXXI or the electricscotland website. Although Culross made wrought iron girdles had  a market they could not compete in price with Carron Co. Thus from 1759, in Scotland, the wrought iron girdle was supplemented and ultimately replaced by the cast iron frying pan - although pancakes cooked on a girdle are still a traditional delicacy - because Carron Co specialised in developing the new design potential in cast iron to mass production which made pots and pans affordable and an everyday item. The honours for developing engineering innovation is claimed by the Shropshire based Coalbrookdale foundry, from 1709 they were able to use coal as fuel to make cast iron for pot and pan making, but on a limited scale. It was from this foundry that Carron Co recruited its ironfounders to start its new ambitious scale of production in Falkirk. Thus a revolution began, one thing led to another a frypan led to a better way of heating it which led to the birth of the cast iron cooking range which then became a search for fuel efficiency and the development of controlled heat for hot water and home warming.
