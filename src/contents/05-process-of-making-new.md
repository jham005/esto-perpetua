title: The process of making a new version
---

The romantic ideal of reconnecting 2021 - when the idea of casting a pan was first discussed - with 1759 by making a cast iron frypan seemed like a solid way of celebrating Ironheart the collective achievements of the Falkirk area foundries and their international significance. A number of factors encouraged further interest: The cast iron frypan can also still be used today, it suits all types of cookers. It has no potentially unpleasant coatings; a patina, a non-stick surface, called seasoning layers of cooking oil built up with use; is also passed down the generations as it never wears out; it can be made from recycled iron.

How hard is it to make a cast iron frypan? Initially it seemed simple just use an old pan as a pattern and get a local foundry to cast it. However the art of making thin castings is a hard won skill. At one time Falkirk specialised in what is called light castings, e.g. thin walled cast iron products like pots, pans, kettles, drain pipes, cooking ranges and bathtubs. Finding a foundry who was prepared to spend time reacquiring this skill was to prove a problem.

I had the advice of two local foundries Ballantine Castings in Bo'ness and Archibald Young's of Kirkintilloch who helped with design problems, which led to John Green's the pattern makers in Clydebank. They were able to help making a pattern using resin, which would make the moulding easier. However it was a chance exchange with Andrew Laing of Laing's foundry, a third generation family foundry now based in Lochgelly, which was the breakthrough. Andrew was enthusiastic to help, but FMF also began learning from him about the different moulding techniques particularly moulding sands: chemical hard set sand and green sand.

### Moulding and casting a cast iron frypan

At Laing's Foundry the traditional technology of using green sand for moulding the pan is used, the very same technique developed at Coalbrookdale in 1707 and used by Carron Co. when it started in 1759. Green sand is a damp mix of quarried sand with clay and other additives including coal dust, in texture, soft but thick enough to stay firm, a balance which introduces a delicacy of handling into the moulding process; being relatively soft the sand can easily be knocked out of shape. The art is to encase the pattern in the green sand then to open the two halves of the casting boxes/flasks, remove the pattern and join the two halves together without causing any movement in the sand. A pour access gate and exhaust air vent has also to be carved into the sand. Pouring molten iron into the gate requires a steady flow, not to quick or slow. The iron has to be at the optimum temperature, 1600c approx, so it flows all the way round the empty space inside the sand mould. The molten iron can be poured either by hand shank or by a pulley controlled ladle, again a sensitive hand is required. Within thirty minutes the sand mould can be broken and the still hot casting examined. Because they are made by hand using green sand every frypan will be slightly different. If chemical resin sand is used a more more consistent finish can be ensured. Why use green sand then? Because its soft it allows finer moulding, but requires highly skilled moulders.

Once the mould is broken open the frypan is revealed but with odd attachments the gate and exit holes are now eveident as they were filled with iron. These have to be broken or ground off. Another job which requires careful hands. It may be that the pan has pinprick airholes or gritty parts where loose sand has fallen in. In the days of piecework - payment by results - payment in the foundries this was always a bone of contention between the nmoulders and the foremen. If minor faults they would be passed and the moulders would be paid - moulders generally worked in pairs - if not a blame game would ensue, because a faulty casting may have also been the fault of the furnaceman - metal not right - or the fettler - poor grinding - etc. As Ironheart frypans are made in small batches of 3 or 4 they do tend to have minor blemishes, but this is acceptable given they are hand made. If the foundry had say an order for 100, the final finish would be more uniform, because of the moulding experience. 
 
The final accepted pan will next have to be heat tested on a gas burner or heater of similar kind. If it does not emit a sharp snap and split it is ready to be used as a cooking implement. The straight from mould finish on the pan is the traditional finish, but sometimes pans are shot or sand blasted for a more vene finish. FMF prefer the mould finish as this would have been the standard traditional way. The pan should then be seasoned either by coating in a cooking oil and bake din an oven or just by repeated cooking use. A new frypan has to be run in like a car, gradually increasing the heat and over time the oil patina creates a non-stick cooking surface. Cleaned by gentle hand rinsing. If treated correctly a cast iron frypan will not wear out, and like the girdle, can be passed onto the next generation. 

The ironheart frypan is a unique practical historical artifact, still a useful cooking tool with a tride and tested history of achievement. The next thing to do is to get a cast iron heat storage cooker, it also reconnects the traditional cast iron range with modern practical efficiency. The cast iron range of Robert Burns was given a revolutionary makeover when in Sweden, Gustav Dalen invented the AGA heat storage cooker in 1922. The Noel prize winning engineer was forced to saty at home buy an industrial injury - he was blinded whilst carrying out an experiment with acetylene gas - and noticed how much time his wife spent preparing for cooking. Despite his sight loss he was ever the optimist and committed his company to this new design of cooker. Arriving in Britain in 1929 the AGA shook up the traditional cookers of the Ironheart foundries who had now to develop their own response. Two Falkirk Iron companies took the challenge seriously: By 1933 Smith & Wellstood, of Bonnybridge, had introduced their own version the Fairy, aimed at a new social development, the new housewife hostess with a new concept of the kitchen. Both the AGA and Fairy offered new standards of cleanliness and all day heat efficiency and were labour saving devices and thus attractive additions to a new idea of the home. Although the AGA and Fairy led innovation they were aimed at the well off, what was needed was a heat storage cooker that was affordable to the general public. Along came Allied Ironfounders (AI) in 1934 and although initially engaged in a patent dispute with AGA, bought them out in 1935 - Dalen was always experimenting thus short of cash - and took over the UK rights, guaranteeing the success of the AGA yet then developing the Rayburn version. ALthough delayed by WW2, the AI Rayburn when launched in 1946 was an immeadite success and became apopular fitting in post-war public housing. These cookers are still in production today, update with new power sources but essentially teh same design - not made in Falkirk - because they combine a variety of features not available elsewhere: home heating, water heating, cooking attributes, attractive designs and add traditional comfort of a 24 hour heat source to a home.
