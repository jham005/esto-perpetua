The romantic ideal of reconnecting 2021 - when the idea of casting a pan was first discussed - with 1759 by making a cast iron frypan seemed like a solid way of celebrating Ironheart the collective achievements of the Falkirk area foundries and their International significance. A number of factors encouraged further interest: The cast iron frypan can also still be used today, it suits all types of cookers. It has no potnetially unpleasant coatings; a patina, a non-stick surface, called seasoning layers of cooking oil built up with use; is also passed down the generatison as it never wears out; it can be made from recycled iron. 
How hard is it to make a cast iron frypan? initially it seemed simple just use an old pan as a pattern and get a local foundry to cast it. However the art of making thin castings is a hard won skill. At one time Falkirk speciallised in what is called light castings eg thin walled cast iron products like pots, pans, kettles, drain pipes, cooking ranges and bathtubs. Finding a foundry who was prepared to spend time reacquiring this skill was to prove a problem.    
I had the advice of two local foundries Ballantine Castings in Bo'ness and Archibald Young's of Kirkintilloch who helped with design problems, which led to John Green's the patternmakers in Clydebank. They were able to help making a patern using resin, which would make the moulding easier. However it was a chance exchange with Andrew Laing of Laing's foundry, a third generation family foundry now based in Lochgelly, which was the breakthrough. Andrew was enthusiastic to help, but FMF also began learning from him about the different moulding techniques partuicularly moulding sands: chemical hard set sand and green sand.      

Moulding and casting a cast iron frypan: AT Laing's Foundry the traditional technology of using green sand for moulding the pan is used. Green sand is a mix of silica rich sand with clay and other additives in texture soft but thick enough to stay firm, a balance which means introduces a delicacy of handling into the moulding process.
