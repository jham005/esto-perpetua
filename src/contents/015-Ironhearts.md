The Ironhearts of Irontown: A regeneration for all ages.

![Ironheart map](../images/Ironheartmap.jpg)


The Ironheart map identifies some of the remaining locations which are associated with the Falkirk area foundries. Many are within walking distance of the start but a complete circuit would measure some 30 miles. Starting at 12 with callandar House Museum where there is inside many iron related exhibits, and outside some restored cast iron lamp posts, a mix of the Saracen foundry, of Glasgow, and Bo'ness Iron Co. a short walk away is the Antonine K6, so named as it sits on the Roman wall, next to the friendly corner shop at Paterson Tower. A regenerated K6 phone kiosk, c1960s. now a Time Kiosk displaying images related to Ironheart achievements. Head to the High St, to find the attractive Robert Burns wall medallion, designed and made in cast iron at the Grahamston foundry c1890. 
Next walk towards Grangemouth and find the Ladysmill K6 next to the railway bridge built by MacLellan's in 1935, a Glasgow rail bridge Co whose thirsty workers inspired the origin of Irn Bru whilst repairing central Sation in Glasgow. This firm would also build the approaches to the Forth railway bridge 'made from girders'. Although more likely the origin of the soft drink is related to a Barr's being a local lemonade company making a non alcoholic drink for thirsty Ironheart foundry workers.

Next is the ironheart mural and iron art sculptures head towards Grahams Rd and at the crossroads with Bainsford Main St cross into Gowan Av. Almost at the end of the road on the building which was formerly the offices of Cockburn's foundry, now Falkirk Brass aka FBS plumbing and bathrooms, is a hand painted wall painting mural which depcts some of the products that were made by the Ironheart foundries, baths, fireplace, cauldron pot, heating stove and Rayburn cooker. The two imaginative bathroom images were designed by school students, nearby just across the Forth & Clyde canal, at St Mungo's High School. The central image is a cheeky Carron Co Phoenix, based on the 1959 bicentenary image, arising from the cooking pot waving the Esto Perpetua flag, the latin motto of Carron Co. 

In the garden area are a range of solid scultural iron art artifacts: A K6 phone kioks doorframe display: An original cast iron bath made in 1951, in Cockburn's Gowanbank foundry, 1864-1977; a small portable kitchen range cooker c1930; two drain covers, the round example made by Grahamston Iron Co, 1868-1990, which was a foundry based right at the end of Gowan Av, maker of the Burn's portrait and the famous Grahamston Arch, now situated at Carron works. Next are two examples of foundry moulding boxes/flasks used to make castings.

Next is a trip down Ironheart alley, actually Gowan Lane, a narrow pathway which seperated the two foundries and leads to the Forth & Clyde canal. Cross the canal and head right towards Grahams Road acoss th eroad and on the left is the former blue and white art deco HQ of Allied Ironfounders - now flats - a grouping of foundries which existed c1922-1970, and revolutionised home cooking with teh Aga and Rayburn heat storage cookers.  
As you cross the canal on the left is an Italian restaurant with stone arches, which was originally Burnbank Foundry, 186-1939, and later the foundry skills training centre. If you follw the canal to the right it takes you past several former foundires, first afte rthe mini roundabout Walker's Merchiston Foundry,1911-85, then to Castlelaurie lane and its red brick arched foundry building, c1850s-1960, now the Ironwork business centre. 
Head back up to the canal crossing and turn to the right into Bainsford Main St, on the left are a block of two story Council flats designed by William Gibson c1930s. Some of the earliest public housing flats in Falkirk designed by someone who was a son of a famous ironfounder family, trained as an architect and became the Burgh Engineer. After the next crossing turn right towards Dawson Park, founded by the Dawson family of Carron Co, in its  middle is a roadway which has at its centre two attractive decorative iron bollards and a the remainder of a public drinking water fountain. at the far end of the park, on Haugh St, is a restored K6 phone kiosk, originally adopted by the Bainsford war Memorial Ass, but which is now in the care of the Friends of Dawson Park. It must be the closest K6 to its origin at Carron Co's Mungal Foundry, which was just across the other side of Carron Rd.
Follw Carron Rd and bear left on the old road to Carron works on Stenhouse Rd. Here you have three options, the clock tower a remnant of the front building which conatins a selction of Carronade guns and historic artifacts implanted it its external wall, a part fo an orinal steal engine cyliner made for James Watt in 1766 and an original part of the first furnace made in 1760. A modern wall plaque recals a vist made to the foundry by Robert Burns. If you venture to follow the river Carron upriver the Grahamston Arch can be found. It was saved and resited here by Carron Phoenix at its works entrance c2002. It is to joined by a K6 phone box wiith display info on the Arch and Carron Co's many achievements.
The Carron Dams are at the back of the works, accessed either by continuing to follow the river or by walking around teh works and following Stenhouse Rd which leads to Stenhousemuir. The Dams are a wild natural environment so take good boots. Originally created to supply Carron Co with a reliable suplly of water which powered the works prior to the success of Watt's highly efficient steam engine c1790s. 
Now follwo stenhouse Rd to teh junction with Main St/King St.
