The Ironhearts of Irontown: A regeneration for all ages.

![Ironheart map](../images/Ironheartmap.jpg)


The Ironheart map identifies some of the remaining locations which are associated with the Falkirk area foundries. Many are within walking distance of the start but a complete circuit would measure some 30 miles. Starting at 12 oclock with callandar House Museum where there is inside many iron related exhibits, and outside some restored cast iron lamp posts, likely made by Mcafarlane's Saracen foundry, of Glasgow, and Bo'ness Iron Co. A short walk away is the Antonine K6, so named as it sits on the Roman wall, along with a series of scenic tower blocks and next to the friendly corner shop at Paterson Tower. A regenerated K6 phone kiosk, c1960s, now a Time Kiosk displaying images related to Ironheart achievements eg: people, products and places. Now head towards Falkirk the High St, to find the celebratory painted Robert Burns wall medallion, designed and made in cast iron at the Grahamston foundry c1890. Burns sepnt one night satying at the Inn here and the legend is he left a poem etched into the window glass.  
Next walk towards Grangemouth Rd and the Ladysmill K6, which is huddled by the railway bridge, built by MacLellan's in 1935. A Glasgow rail bridge Co whose thirsty workers inspired the origin of Irn Bru whilst repairing central Sation in Glasgow. This firm would also build the approaches to the Forth railway bridge 'made from girders'. Although a more likely origin of the soft drink is related to a Barr's being a local lemonade company, making a non alcoholic drink for thirsty Ironheart foundry workers.

Next is the ironheart mural and iron art sculptures head towards Grahams Rd and at the crossroads with Bainsford Main St cross into Gowan Av. Almost at the end of the road on the building which was formerly the offices of Cockburn's foundry, now Falkirk Brass aka FBS plumbing and bathrooms, is a hand painted wall painting mural which depcts some of the products that were made by the Ironheart foundries, baths, fireplace, cauldron pot, heating stove and Rayburn cooker. The two imaginative bathroom images were designed by school students, nearby just across the Forth & Clyde canal, at St Mungo's High School. The central image is a cheeky Carron Co Phoenix, based on the 1959 bicentenary image, arising from the cooking pot waving the Esto Perpetua flag, the Latin motto of Carron Co. 
In the garden area are a range of solid scultural iron art artifacts: A K6 phone kioks doorframe display: An original cast iron bath made in 1951, in Cockburn's Gowanbank foundry, 1864-1977; a small portable kitchen range cooker c1930; two drain covers, the round example made by Grahamston Iron Co, 1868-1990, which was a foundry based right at the end of Gowan Av, maker of the Burn's portrait and the famous Grahamston Arch, now situated at Carron works. Next are two examples of foundry moulding boxes/flasks used to make castings. 

The mini cast iron bathtubs were originally made in Cockburn's foundry. Finding and remaking them new is another solid way of re-connecting with the public health achievements of Ironheart. Cockburn's was part of of the Allied ironfounders combine c1922-1970 and sp[eciallised in cast iron bath productiuon.

The hallway of the building has a small display of artifacts related to the foundry and the current family company, FBS aka Falkirk Brass, which is itself originally an Ironheart brass foundry c1890, and now a specialist plumbing and bathroom company. The FBS building has with teh support of the family, become the main centre of Ironheart heritage.

Inside the entrance to FBS are a number of framed displasy relating to the history of the family who run Falkirk Brass and photos of the foundry and some of its staff c1938. Additional exhibits are in process both inside and outside.

Next is a trip down Ironheart alley, actually Gowan Lane, a narrow pathway which seperated the two foundries and leads to the Forth & Clyde canal. Cross the canal and head right towards Grahams Road acoss th eroad and on the left is the former blue and white art deco HQ of Allied Ironfounders - now flats - a grouping of foundries which existed c1922-1970, and revolutionised home cooking with the Aga and Rayburn heat storage cookers.  
As you cross the canal on the left is an Italian restaurant with stone arches, which was originally Burnbank Foundry, 186-1939, and later the foundry skills training centre. If you follw the canal to the right it takes you past several former foundires, first after the mini roundabout is Walker's Merchiston Foundry,1911-85, then to Castlelaurie lane and its red brick arched window foundry building, c1850s-1960, now the Ironwork business centre. 
Head back up to the canal crossing and turn to the right into Main St, Bainsford. On the left are a block of two story Council flats designed by William Gibson c1930s. Some of the earliest public housing flats in Falkirk designed by someone who was a son of a famous ironfounder family, started as an ironfounder at the Salton Foundry - and patented, and sold to the Coalbrookdale Foundry, an innnovative smoke consuming cooker design in 1910 - who trained as an architect and became the Burgh Engineer c1910-35. His father John Edward managed Camelon Iron Co until he founded teh Salton Foundry in c1894. He was a leading force in founded a school of art and design in Falkirk, c1878. His mother Harriette Gibson led the Ironfounder campaign for the first public general hospital in Falkirk. Salton or Falkirk Cottage Infirmary opened in 1889. Harriette was also an active ironfounder and managed Salton foundry with her son William. Her other son Roberts and John would find fame and fortune in Melbourne, Australia.

Continuing North and after the next crossing any right turn takes you to towards Dawson Park, donated for public use by the Dawson family of Carron Co in 1904. In its  middle is a roadway which has at its centre two attractive decorative iron bollards and a the remainder of a public drinking water fountain. at the far end of the park, on Haugh St, is a restored K6 phone kiosk, originally adopted by the Bainsford war Memorial Ass, but which is now in the care of the Friends of Dawson Park. It must be the closest K6 to its origin at Carron Co's Mungal Foundry, which was just across the other side of Carron Rd.

Follw Carron Rd and bear left on the old road to Carron works on Stenhouse Rd. Here you have three options: 1. The clock tower a remnant of the front building which conatins a selction of Carronade guns and historic artifacts implanted it its external wall, a part of an original steam engine cyliner made for James Watt in 1766 and an original part of the first furnace made in 1760. A modern wall plaque recals a vist made to the foundry by Robert Burns. 
2. If you venture to follow the river Carron upriver the Grahamston Arch can be found. It was saved and resited here by Carron Phoenix at its works entrance c2002. It is to joined by a K6 phone box wiith display info on the Arch and Carron Co's many achievements. 
3. The Carron Dams are at the back of the works, accessed either by continuing to follow the river or by walking around the large works wall and follow the Stenhouse Rd which leads to Stenhousemuir. The Dams are a wild natural environment so take good boots. Originally created to supply Carron Co with a reliable supply of water which powered the iron works prior to the success of Watt's highly efficient steam engine c1790s.

Stenhousemuir is next on the map: tThe Tryst K6 at the junction of King St and Central Drive. Follow stenhouse Rd to the junction with Main St/King St and turn right. This Carron Co K6 is dated 1949 with a display of three parts: 1. Achievers who were trained at Carron Co and went on to fame and fortune; 2. In introduction to Ironhearts of Iron Town story: 3. Artwork by Larbert High School students on teh subject of iron foundry products and the Bruce Obelisk in Larbert Old Church kirkyard. Next is the life size Tryst Highland Cattle sculptures designed by Alan Potter and made in cast iron by Ballantine Castings in Bo'ness, 2016. Stenhousemuir was a tryst or hub for cattle trading 1785-1900. Continue along Main St to the next location, the Dobbie Hall. The hall and library was built by Major Robert Dobbie of the Dobbie Forbes Larbert Foundry in Larbert 1870-2001, and gifted for public use. Internally the hall has attractive decorations and features. The front doors has an exceptional wrought ironwork design.

Transport may be needed to make the next locations: Letham Village, between Larbert, Bellsdyke Rd and Airth, built by Carron Co as Miners row cottages for a local coal mine c1913-22. It is now a Council owned conservation housing area. An example of enlightened worker housing in the spirit of the garden suburb movement. Next back to Larbert Cross to Larbert Old Church kirkyard where sits a recently renovated gem of Ironheart, the James Bruce Obelisk made by Carron Co c1785, perhaps the first example of decorative ironwork made for praivate commission of the Industrial Revolution. Designed in the style of Robert & John Adam by William Haworth. It was made for his wife, Mary Dundas, as a lost love memorial and cna be considered with the same meaning as the Taj Mahal. The kirkyard is also of Ironheart interest
as here are buried many of the cast iron leaders of the Industrial revolution including The Carron Co enclosure. A trip to Carriden kirkyard in Bo'ness is required to view the grav eof Prof John Roebuck one of the founders of Carron Co. The Kirkyard has an exceptional amount of cast iron gravemarkers many of them made by George Smith's Sun Foundry, a leading decorative art iron foundry in the c19th.

Denny is next, turn left out of the kirkyard on the Denny Rd, then left at Denny Cross, on the right opposite the Sainsbury's supermarket, is the attractive office block, 1914, of the Cruikshanks Denny Foundry 1863-1984. Finally continue on the glasgow Road past the Head of Muir BT K6 phone kiosk and eventually left into Bonnybridge Rd. Then into the town and left at the roundabout up to the canal crossing and on the right can be seen the office block of the Smith & Wellstood foundry, origin of the Esse heat storage cooker. In this High Bonnybridge area are many remnants of iron foundry buildings further up on the left leads to the Chattan Foundry now mainly used by motor related engineering firms.

You can pick and choose what locations you visit, essentially the Ironheart map is an introduction to a surprising number of surviving buildings and artifacts in the Falkirk area. The addition of displays in K6s and the Ironheart mural and iron art sculpture garden are recent developments carried out voluntarily by Falkirk Made Friends in 2019, in partnership with local firms and Falkirk Council.
