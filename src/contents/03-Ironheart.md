title: Ironheart, collective contribution Falkirk area foundries made to improving public health
---
Although Carron Company was the first cast iron foundry in the Falkirk area it was consequently the source of ambitious engineers who would open their own foundries turn both Falkirk into a national hub for cast iron lighty castings, used for domestic improvement, but also radiate innovative engineers across the world. Carron Co led the Industrial Revolution and was in 1759 the first planned large scale modern technical iron foundry in the world. Consequently their engineers were at the cutting edge of new ideas, and rare skills and experience which were in great demand in other countries.

Carron Co's ambitious irnfounders would fairly quickly be sought by people who wanted to establsih the latest engineering technology in their own country, initially this was in Russia and Eastern Europe c1780-1830. However in the Falkirk area Carron Co had no competitors for 45 years, until George Sherriff, one of those engineers, returned with wealth from Russia and established, in 1804, the Dalderse Foundry, sited by newly completed the Forth & Clyde canal, as Carron Co's first local competitor.   

Although not popular with Carron Co, competition is the spur to innovation, Dalderse evolved, by 1819, into Falkirk Iron Co which would always maintain a competitive attitude to Carron Co. A doubling of the foundry skills meant even more ambitious engineers and as the area became a hub of specilist skills in kitechen range and hot water heating it also became a hub of innovation. Over the next one hudred years arise some sixty foundries, all engaged in making better cookers and hot water heaters. Some of the most radical developments included the success of the portable American kitchen range cooker developed by Smith & Wellstood, based in Bonnybridge. Its foundry success was led by George Ure a Carron Co trained grate fitter. The succes of this appealing cooker ensured a dmeand which fueled the origin of many new foundries including the Uinon, Camelon, Grahamston, Cockburn's. The search for innovation led to the development of gas and electric powered cookers, particularly centred in the Camelon area foundries including; Forth & Clyde and Sunnyside, and R&A Main.      

Ease of transportationw as also an attraction, many were based along the Forth & Clyde canal, which enabled access to shipping at Grangemouth and Glasgow, but when the railways arrived locations further afield began appearing.
