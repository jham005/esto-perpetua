title: The Legacy of Esto Perpetua, Carron Co.'s motto, to live forever
---

What does 'Esto Perpetua' mean? One translation from Latin being: 'to live forever', a grand, and striking, and claim for Carron Company in 1773. It was the fashion at that time to use Latin mottos; James Watt used 'Ingenio et Labore'. meaning by 'ability and hard work' which complements Carron Co. as both achievers have not been forgotten. James Watt did also develop his early experiments on the steam engine at Carron Co. in the 1760s. However cast iron has an inbuilt longevity, being inherently rust resistant, and, in everyday conditions, it should last a very long time. But other reasons than longevity ensured its abandonment e.g., changes in fashion and light weight alternatives.

According to cooking legend, cast iron has unique cooking properties, with a seasoned non-stick surface created by cooking oil use over many years; and no hot spots as heat spreads evenly across the pan which ensures a stable and uniform heated cooking surface Cast iron hotplates are renowned for this quality, as in the Ironheart legacy cookers e.g, the current chef's favourite, the Falcon Dominator cooker, as well as the domestic Aga/Esse/Rayburn/Stanley versions. This unique quality adds the mystery ingredient; 'taste'.  An Ironheart made cast iron pan would survive, as it does not wear out, and be passed down the generations like a pancake & bannock girdle = The Ironheart frypan is a useful tool which will last forever.  

## Carron Co. its images

The motto was part of an official seal or coat of Arms image of Carron Co., adopted in 1774, but revised over the years:

1. A dramatic fired up phoenix, used on Carron Co. documents c1800
2. A more restrained phoenix comfortable on the fire.

The others meanings of the symbolism in the Carron Co. seal:
The phoenix arising from the fire is a legendary symbol of renewal, in this case both representing both the birth of Carron Co. and the transformation of raw ore into iron products. Carron Co. was the only Foundry in eth falkirk area to melt iron ore into pig iron, which was then used to make the frypans etc. Carron Co. also sold this pig iron to other foundries and companies including Shanks of Arbroath and Singer Sewing machines of Clydebank.

The three crossed canons and canon balls represent its aim  in 1783 to supply munitions for defence. In its own case it used its Carronades to defend its own shipping line from privateers aka pirates. However, despite setbacks, it was to become the biggest arsenal of military munitions in Britain supply the army with long guns and the navy with short barrel Carronades during the Napoleonic wars. It earned the right to bear arms in its coat of arms.

How the other Ironheart foundries:

* Falkirk Iron Co. coat of arms c1820; iron a shared partnership, image with symbols of ironfounding. Used 'Falkirk' as casting trade mark.
* Malcolm Cockburn's Gowanbank foundry casting trade mark, found mainly on old baths, like an upside down house.
* 'CICO', Calendar Iron Co. use a stylised fruit tree as a badge, the foundry was built on an old orchard. Growing anew?
* Dorrator Iron Co. 1897-c1994. Stove and cooker makers who in the 1920s had a cheeky wee elf running off with a loaf? as their company logo.

!{Federated Foundries badge}

Federated Foundries (FF), the other nationwide foundry combine with four Falkirk foundries: Burnbank, Camelon, Grangemouth aka Grange & Watson Gow. FF merged into AI, in an unsuccessful reorganisation, in 1965.

!{Grahamston Iron Co. badge}

Grahamston Iron Co., tall diamond with G inside trade mark. Commonly seen on cast iron rain water and sanitation drainage pipes.

Smith & Wellstood 1860-1993 also based Bonnybridge used a dolphin as a company image. According to legend James Smith survived a shipwreck on the Atlantic Ocean on a raft with laundry basket for protection. A dolphin kept him company and in good spirits until he was rescued.

The later Allied Ironfounders badge was designed by the world famous Raymond Loewy design studio, which also redesigned the look of the Otto & Apollo room heating stoves c1937, and the AGA cooker from 1942. The revolutionary Rayburn solid fuel heat storage cooker introduced in 1946 was also styled Raymond Loewy Associates. An AI gas cooker was designed by him and called the Raymond. Raymond Loewy was a highly successful designer in America.

Allied Ironfounders deserves a mention, if not a book on its achievements:
The larger Allied Ironfounders merger of twelve foundries in 1929, grew out of the small grouping the Light castings Group of 1922, which composed of two Falkirk foundries McDowall Steven & Co. and Malcolm Cockburn's Gowanbank foundry with the Manchester based Planet foundry and the Shropshire based Coalbrookdale Foundry. In 1929 this expanded to include 12 foundries six in the Falkirk area. A new AI HQ was built in Graham's Rd., Falkirk, in 1938, because the chairman was the Falkirk ironfounder Alexander Steven (of McDowall Steven & Co). Although making an incredible contribution to making better domestic products, after a period of poor decision making, particularly the agony of the Australian misadventure 1952-29, AI was bought out by Glynwed in 1969. See chapter 6.

Glynwed a metals combine consolidated its assets and closed most of the AI Falkirk area foundries. It was renamed AGA Foodservice in 2001. The only local remaining former AI brand is Falcon Foodservice who make commerical kitchen equipment cookers, fryers, ovens etc. It moved from its Larbert foundry base in 2004 to the former Wang factory, Causewayhead, by Stirling University, where it flies high.

Allied Ironfounders deserves a mention, if not a book on its achievements: In summary these include: Buying the licence to make the Swedish Aga cooker in 1935; the introduction od radical modern designs for room heater stoves in 1936-7, the Otto and the Apollo; The launch of the affordable Rayburn insulated cooker in 1946; The Allied Train exhibition in 1948 a touring display of new  modern domestic equipment. In 1952 the Stockton Experiment, buying and renovating a row of terraced houses and improving them with modern domestic heating and hot water and bathing products. AI were also responsible for staring the first iron museum in Coalbrookdale at Ironbridge, which would become a world heritage site.  

In summary, Carron Co. was the first Ironheart foundry, its legacy includes many other foundries and related companies local, national and International. Allied Ironfounders, for a time c1930-60 added a competitive drive to innovation in Ironheart which was to the benefit of all. Although these foundry names may slip discarded from the pages of history, their products live on. Many of the people who set up competitor foundries trained at Carron Co. The first challenger was George Sherriff who became wealthy working In Russia in the 1790s, he set up the Dalderse Foundry in 1805, followed in 1810s by Falkirk Iron Works all adding the area's growing skill base so at any time after the 1880s, until c1970, some thirty foundries could be at work at any time. Hard to imagine thirty foundries working at once. The Bo'ness foundries had easy access to shipping, but the other light castings foundries spread initially along the Forth and Clyde canal because of the ease of transportation, starting with Abotts at Bankside, then along both sides one foundry after another (Ten) until Portdownie in Camelon then jumping to Bonnybridge. When the railways arrived c1840s foundries sprang up in other places including Denny. Even further the light casting skill base spread: In the West to Kirkintilloch and Possilpark in Glasgow. In the East to Linlithgowm, Dunfermline and Edinburgh. All were using the skill base and techniques that originated in Carron Co.

A recently discovered Ironheart product illustrates the many qualities of Ironheart:
The most famous literary Ironheart heating stove is in the museum home of Virginia Woolf's home, Monk's House in W.Sussex. Its an AI Apollo model made at Falkirk Iron Co. from c1937 and finished in a rare cobalt green enamel colour. Most likely chosen because this was Virginia's favourite colour. The legend at Monk's house is that EM Forster (the author of Room With a View etc) stood to close and overheated, singeing his trousers, yet he was inspired to write a poem about it. In this case Forster has now given another Ironheart product a chance to live forever this time in literary legend.
