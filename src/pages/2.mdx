title: "Ironheart and the Ironhearts of Irontown: physical and literary"
---

Ironheart offers a rich variety of intriguing visitor locations, whilst the Ironhearts storybook is a fantastic way to tell the story of products that changed the world, for the better: 'Iron is Falkirk's Gold'.

## Locations

The Ironheart map identifies some of the remaining locations which are associated with the Falkirk area foundries. Many are within walking distance of the start but a complete circuit would measure some thirty miles.

![Ironheart map](Ironheart-map)

Starting at 12 o'clock with Callendar House Museum where there are many iron related exhibits including cast iron post and pans; a decorative iron bench, a large vase like stove, examples of intricate patterns for moulding; Large and small model Carronades, models of Carron works c1800 and a Watt steam engine. Outside are some restored Provost's cast iron lamp posts - originally the Provost, the leading councillor, had a lamp post outside his home -  made by Macfarlane's Saracen foundry, of Glasgow, and the others, possibly by Bo'ness Iron Co.

A short walk away is the Antonine K6, so named as it sits by the Roman wall, along with a series of scenic tower blocks, and next to the friendly corner shop at Paterson Tower. This regenerated K6 was installed when the tower blocks were built in the mid 1960s. It is now displays a selection of Ironheart images related to Ironheart achievements e.g.: people, products and places (pictured elsewhere in this website). 

![Wall medallion of Robert Burns](Robert Burns)

For the next attraction on the Iron Trail head west towards Falkirk the High St., where can be found a cast iron wall plaque or medallion of Scotland's national bard, Robert Burns.  Burns spent one night at Cross Keys Inn here and the legend is he left behind a poem etched into the window glass. Burns may well ahvelefthis mark yet it It is a part of the Burns legend to mark the places where he slept with wall plaques.  In this case the decorative wall medallion was designed in, and made of cast iron, at the Grahamston foundry c1880s whilst William Thomson Mitchell (1835-94) the foundry founder was still alive. It is a neatly styled  portrait, the head is cushioned by delicately shaped flowers possibly referring to his nature poems, perhaps 'On a Bank of Flowers'.  It had a grand public launch in 1889, unveiled by Sir Thomas Brodie Dawson, of Carron Co, the leading Ironheart foundry at this time. The link being that William T Mitchell had trained as a pattern maker at Carron Co.   

1[Ladysmill Bridge & K6] (Ladysmill K6) 

Next head towards Bells Meadow and the Grangemouth Rd. where the Ladysmill K6 is hugged by the railway bridge. Th eK6 display tells the story of the bridge, its maker and its links with a famous locla soft drink Barr's 'Irn Bru'. The bridge built by P& W MacLellan's in 1935, a Glasgow firm of structural engineers who made railway bridges. The Barr's origin legend is that the soft drink was created for the engineers working on Glasgow Central Station thirsty workers. MacLellan's also built the railway approaches to the Forth railway bridge, which links Barr;'s advert that Iron Bru is 'made from girders' alongside images of the famous Railway bridge over the Forth, although it is made from steel. Although, a more likely origin of the soft drink is related to a Barr's being a local lemonade company, making a non alcoholic high energy drink to refresh the hot and thirsty Ironheart foundry workers. In 1901

Next is the Ironheart mural and iron art sculpture display. Head north towards Grahams Rd. and just before the crossroads with Bainsford Main St. cross into Gowan Av. Almost at the end of the road on the building which was formerly the offices of Cockburn's foundry - now Falkirk Brass aka FBS plumbing and bathrooms - is a hand painted wall painting mural which depicts some of the products that were made by the Ironheart foundries, baths, fireplace, cauldron pot, heating stove and Rayburn cooker. The two imaginative bathroom images were designed by school students, nearby just across the Forth & Clyde canal, at St. Mungo's High School. The central image is a cheeky Carron Co. Phoenix - based on the 1959 bicentenary image - arising from the cooking pot waving the Esto Perpetua flag, the Latin motto of Carron Co.

In the garden area are a range of solid sculptural iron art artifacts: a K6 phone kiosk door frame display; two original cast iron baths one buy Carron Co in 1969, and the other here in 1951, inside Cockburn's Gowanbank foundry, 1864-1977; along with a blue enamel cast iron bathroom basin; alongside, three artifacts mounted on an old wooden railway sleeper, a Romesse Stove made by Smith &  Wellstood c1960s, a pair of cast iron radiators and a wash house furnace bowl; standing in the middle is an example of small kitchen range cooker c1900; by it are two examples of manhole cover, the square example made by Bo'ness Iron Co., c1970s, the round example, c1930s, made by Grahamston Iron Co., 1868-1994, which was a foundry based right at the end of Gowan Av. Grahamston also made the Burn's portrait in the High Street and the famous Grahamston Arch, now situated at the west, riverside, entrance to Carron works. Next are two examples of foundry moulding boxes/flasks which were used to make castings. This display is being added to... 
Other items of interest here are that: 
The mini cast iron bathtubs were originally made in Cockburn's foundry. Finding and remaking them new is another solid way of re-connecting with the public health achievements of Ironheart. Cockburn's was part of of the Allied ironfounders combine c1922-1970 and specialised in cast iron bath and sink production.
In the hallway of the FBS building has a small display of artifacts related to the foundry and the current family company, FBS aka Falkirk Brass, which is itself originally an Ironheart brass foundry c1890, and now a specialist plumbing and bathroom company. A display of two photographs of Cockburn's in the 1930s; A collage of Plumbing related parts and a small display of the family related Sime's hardware shop in the Cow Wynd.  The FBS building has with the support of this foundry family run business become a main centre of Ironheart heritage. Falkirk Brass dates back to the 1870s, originally a foundry which became a plumbers merchant and bathroom sales showroom.

Next step is a scenic trip down Ironheart alley, actually Gowan Lane, a narrow pathway which separated the two foundries and leads to the Forth & Clyde canal. Follow the path, cross the canal and head right towards Grahams Road across the road and on the left is the former blue and white art deco HQ of Allied Ironfounders - now flats - a grouping of foundries which existed c1922-1970, and revolutionised home cooking with the development of the insulated cookers, the Aga and Rayburn. Around it is are modern housing but it was all once the site of a huge foundry, home of Falkirk Iron Co c1810s until it closed c1983. The streets recall this as they are named 'castings', a name used for the foundry's social club. Further behind one is called Glywed Ct, named after the last company to operate the foundry.    

As you cross the canal on the left is an Italian restaurant with stone arches, which is a remnant of Burnbank foundry, 1860-1939, and later the foundry skills training centre until the 1960s. If you follow the canal towards Grangemmouth it takes you past several former foundries, first after the mini roundabout is Walker's Merchiston foundry, 1911-85 - now Forth Carz - then to Castlelaurie lane and its red brick arched window foundry building, c1850s-1960, which was part of the Falkirk Iron Co estate and sued by McDowall Steven & Co until 1965, home to Green Machines street cleaners and now the Ironwork business centre.

Head back up to the canal crossing, and turn to the right into Main St., Bainsford. On the left are a block of two story Council flats designed by William Gibson c1930s. Some of the earliest public housing flats in Falkirk designed by the youngest son of a famous ironfounder family, traind as an ironfounder at Camelon and then the Salton foundry - and patented, and sold to the Coalbrookdale foundry, an innovative smoke consuming cooker design in 1910 - who also trained as an architect and became the Falkirk Burgh Surveyer/Engineer c1912-38. His father John Edward managed Camelon Iron Co. until he founded the Salton foundry in c1894, who was a leading force for education and led a campaign for a school of art and design in Falkirk, c1878. John's wife, and William's mother, Harriette Hickes Gibson led the Ironfounder campaign for the first public general hospital in Falkirk. Salton or Falkirk Cottage Infirmary which opened in 1889. Harriette was also an active ironfounder and managed Salton foundry with her son William. Two of her other sons Robert (Ironfounder) and John (Civil engineer in concrete) would find solid fame and fortune in Melbourne, Australia, c1910-30.

Continuing North and after the next crossing the right turns will take you towards Dawson Park, donated 1904 by the Dawson family of Carron Co. and opend o public use in 1910. In its  middle is a roadway is a William Dawson designed pavlion used by Grahamstone boys Football club, next to it which are two original attractive decorative iron bollards and the remainder of a public drinking water fountain by Glendale of Kilmarnock. Th efRiends of Dawson Park woudl like to restore booth teh Pavilion and teh fountain. At the far end of the park, on Haugh St., is a restored K6 phone kiosk, originally adopted by the Bainsford war Memorial Ass, but which is now in the care of the Friends of Dawson Park. It must be the closest K6 to its origin at Carron Co.'s Mungal foundry, which was just across the other side of Carron Rd. At present insatlled with a school student artwork display about the environment.

![Carron works c1938](Carron-works-1938)

Follow Carron Road and bear left on the old road to Carron works on Stenhouse Road. Here you have three options:

1. The clock tower a remnant of the front building which contains a selection of Carronade guns and historic artifacts implanted it its external wall, a part of an original steam engine cylinder made for James Watt in 1766 and an original part of the first furnace made in 1760. A modern wall plaque recalls a visit made to the foundry by Robert Burns. The arch contains four guns also know as Carronades, two long barrel artillery pieces and two smaller 'smashers' for use on ships. The legend is that Nelson used similar at Trafalgar and Wellington at Waterloo. In Nelson's era ships fought at close quarters blasting each other at short range.

2. If you venture to follow the river Carron upriver the Grahamston Arch can be found. It was saved and resited here by Carron Phoenix at its works entrance c2002. It is now joined (Summer 2025) by The Carron Phoenix K6 phone box with display 0f Ironheart information on the Arch and Carron Co.'s many achievements.

![Carron Phoenix K6 and Arch](CarronPhoenixK6Mar25)

3. The Carron Dams are at the back of the works, accessed either by continuing to follow the river or by walking around the large works wall and follow the Stenhouse Rd. which leads to Stenhousemuir. The Dams are a wild natural environment so take good boots. Originally created to supply Carron Co. with a reliable supply of water which powered the iron works prior to being repaleced by the success of Watt's highly efficient steam engine c1790s.

![Carron dams](Carron-dams)

Stenhousemuir is next on the map: The Tryst K6 at the junction of King St. and Central Drive. To get to that follow Stenhouse Rd. to the junction with Main St./King St. and turn right. This Carron Co. K6 is dated 1949 with a display of three parts:

1. Achievers who were trained at Carron Co. and went on to fame and fortune;
2. In introduction to Ironhearts of Iron Town story;
3. Artwork by Larbert High School students on the subject of iron foundry products and the Bruce Obelisk in Larbert Old Church kirkyard.

Next on the map, off Main st, is the life size Tryst Highland Cattle sculptures, designed by Alan Potter, and made in cast iron by Ballantine Castings in Bo'ness, 2016. Stenhousemuir was a tryst or hub for cattle trading 1785-1900. To get there, go back along King St. down Hallam St, toward Main St.  The next location, is on the Dobbie Hall is on Main Street. The hall and library was built by Major Robert Dobbie of the Dobbie Forbes Larbert foundry in Larbert 1870-2001, he gifted it for public use. Internally the hall has attractive decorations and features. The front doors has an exceptional wrought ironwork bracing design. It is still a popular local community asset used by many local groups and shows many operas and musical dramas.

![Dobbie Hall](Dobbiehalldoorscal)

Transport will be needed to make the next location, Letham Village, between Bellsdyke Rd, Larbert, and Airth. Built by Carron Co. as Miners row cottages for a local coal mine c1913-22. It is now a Council owned conservation housing area. An example of enlightened worker housing in the spirit of the garden suburb movement. 

![Letham village](LethamCottages-calendar)

Next back to Larbert Cross to Larbert Old Church kirkyard where sits a recently renovated gem of Ironheart, the James Bruce Obelisk made by Carron Co. c1785, perhaps the first example of decorative ironwork made for private commission of the Industrial Revolution. Designed in the style of Robert & John Adam by William Haworth. It was made for his wife, Mary Dundas, as a lost love memorial and can be considered with the same meaning as the Taj Mahal. The kirkyard is also of Ironheart interest. Here are buried many of the cast iron leaders of the Industrial revolution including The Carron Co. enclosure. (A trip to Carriden kirkyard Bo'ness is required to view the grave of Prof John Roebuck one of the founders of Carron Co.). The Kirkyard has an exceptional amount of cast iron grave markers many of them made by George Smith's Sun foundry, a leading decorative art iron foundry in the 19th century. Smith learned his as a pattern maker skills at Carron Co.

A distant trip to Denny is next, turn left out of the kirkyard onto the Denny Rd., into Denny, then left at Denny Cross, on the right opposite the Sainsbury's supermarket, is the attractive office block, 1914, of the Cruikshanks Denny foundry (1863-1984), associated with cutting edge farming tools and laterally specialist engineering iron and steel.

Finally continue on the Glasgow Road past the Head of Muir K6 phone kiosk (BT owned at presnet but may be adopted) and eventually left into Bonnybridge Rd. Then into the town and left at the roundabout up to the canal crossing and on the right can be seen the office block of the Smith & Wellstood foundry, origin of the Esse heat storage cooker, since 1984 continued by the Ouzledale Foundry and now at its base in Barnoldswick, Lancs. In this High Bonnybridge area are many remnants of iron foundry buildings further up on the left leads to the large scattered Chattan foundry site, now mainly used by motor related engineering firms and HQ of Central Demolition.

You can pick and choose what locations you visit, essentially the Ironheart map is an introduction to a surprising number of surviving buildings and artifacts in the Falkirk area. The addition of displays in K6s and the Ironheart mural and iron art sculpture garden are recent developments carried out voluntarily by Falkirk Made Friends in 2019, in partnership with local firms and Falkirk Council. One way of explaining the significance of the achievements of the Falkirk area iron foundries is to read the story 'The Ironhearts of Irontown':

![Ironheart booklet](Ironheart-booklet-2024)

The booklet is an idea of Ironheart communicated through a fantastical story: 
Ironheart & the Ironhearts of Irontown: The Phoenix Awakes, is a fantastic story which offers an alternative means of telling the meaning of Ironheart. its multiple layers of meaning about the products associated with Irontown offers a variety of ways of comprehending the achievements of Ironheart. The combination of attractive images, real historical locations and products with an amusing tale about finding a new purpose offers insights into the achievements of public use products made in Irontown aka Ironheart. Starting with the everyday icons of public service the letter post and telephone boxes, whose use is in decline. Whom by a fantastic discovery are enabled to move and decide to return to Irontown, an aim that seemed simple but turned out be complicated by what happens on the way and what they find in Irontown. How they deal with the situation in Irontown offers an example to anyone who seeks a new purpose.
