title: "Ironheart and The Ironhearts of Irontown: A Regeneration Tale for all Ages"
---

Ironheart is a location and a celebration of products that changed the world for the better.
Locations:
The Ironheart map identifies some of the remaining locations which are associated with the Falkirk area foundries. Many are within walking distance of the start but a complete circuit would measure some thirty miles.

![Ironheart map](Ironheart-map)

Starting at 12 o'clock with Callendar House Museum where there is inside many iron related exhibits including cast iron post and pans; a decorative iron bench, a large vase like stove, examples of intricate patterns for moulding; Large and small model Carronades, models of Carron works c1800 and a Watt steam engine. Outside are some restored Provost's cast iron lamp posts - originally the Provost, the leading coucillor, had a lamp post outside his home -  made by Macfarlane's Saracen foundry, of Glasgow, and the others possibly by Bo'ness Iron Co. 
A short walk away is the Antonine K6, so named as it sits on the Roman wall, along with a series of scenic tower blocks and next to the friendly corner shop at Paterson Tower. This K6 regenerated K6 was installed when the tower blocks were built mid c1960s. It is now a Time Kiosk displaying images related to Ironheart achievements e.g.: people, products and places. Now head towards Falkirk the High St., to find the celebratory painted Robert Burns wall medallion, designed and made in cast iron at the Grahamston foundry c1890. Burns spent one night staying at the Inn here and the legend is he left behind a poem etched into the window glass.  

Next head towards Bells Meadow and the Grangemouth Rd. where the Ladysmill K6 is hugged by the railway bridge. A bridge built by P& W MacLellan's in 1935. A Glasgow firm opf stu+ructural engineers who made railway bridges. It is a legend taht their thirsty workers inspired the origin of Irn Bru, whilst repairing central Station in Glasgow. This firm would also build the approaches to the Forth railway bridge 'made from girders'. Although a more likely origin of the soft drink is related to a Barr's being a local lemonade company, making a non alcoholic high energy drink for thirsty, physically drained and hot Ironheart foundry workers.

![Ironheart mural in January 2025](Ironheart-mural-2025-01-31)

Next is the ironheart mural and iron art sculpture display. Head towards Grahams Rd. and just before the crossroads with Bainsford Main St. cross into Gowan Av. Almost at the end of the road on the building which was formerly the offices of Cockburn's foundry - now Falkirk Brass aka FBS plumbing and bathrooms - is a hand painted wall painting mural which depicts some of the products that were made by the Ironheart foundries, baths, fireplace, cauldron pot, heating stove and Rayburn cooker. The two imaginative bathroom images were designed by school students, nearby just across the Forth & Clyde canal, at St. Mungo's High School. The central image is a cheeky Carron Co. Phoenix - based on the 1959 bicentenary image - arising from the cooking pot waving the Esto Perpetua flag, the Latin motto of Carron Co.

In the garden area are a range of solid sculptural iron art artifacts: a K6 phone kiosk door frame display; an original cast iron bath made in 1951, in Cockburn's Gowanbank foundry, 1864-1977; an example of small kitchen range cooker c1920; The square example made by Bo'ness Iron Co, c1970s, the round example, c1930s, made by Grahamston Iron Co., 1868-1990, which was a foundry based right at the end of Gowan Av.. Grahamston also made the Burn's portrait in the High Street - not yet included in teh map - and the famous Grahamston Arch, now situated at the west, riverside, entrance to Carron works. Next are two examples of foundry moulding boxes/flasks which were used to make castings.

The mini cast iron bathtubs were originally made in Cockburn's foundry. Finding and remaking them new is another solid way of re-connecting with the public health achievements of Ironheart. Cockburn's was part of of the Allied ironfounders combine c1922-1970 and specialised in cast iron bath and sink production.

The hallway of the FBS building has a small display of artifacts related to the foundry and the current family company, FBS aka Falkirk Brass, which is itself originally an Ironheart brass foundry c1890, and now a specialist plumbing and bathroom company. A display of two photographs of Cockburn's in the 1930s; A collage of Plumbing related parts and a small display of the family related Sime's hardware shop in the Cow Wynd.  The FBS building has with the support of this foundry family run business become a main centre of Ironheart heritage. Falkirk Brass dates back to the 1870s, originaly a foundry which became a plumbers merchant and bathroom sales showroom.

Next step is a scenic trip down Ironheart alley, actually Gowan Lane, a narrow pathway which separated the two foundries and leads to the Forth & Clyde canal. Follow the path, cross the canal and head right towards Grahams Road across the road and on the left is the former blue and white art deco HQ of Allied Ironfounders - now flats - a grouping of foundries which existed c1922-1970, and revolutionised home cooking with the Aga and Rayburn heat storage cookers.

As you cross the canal on the left is an Italian restaurant with stone arches, which was originally Burnbank foundry, 1860-1939, and later the foundry skills training centre. If you follow the canal on the right it takes you past several former foundries, first after the mini roundabout is Walker's Merchiston foundry, 1911-85 - now Forth Carz - then to Castlelaurie lane and its red brick arched window foundry building, c1850s-1960, now the Ironwork business centre.

Head back up to the canal crossing, and turn to the right into Main St., Bainsford. On the left are a block of two story Council flats designed by William Gibson c1930s. Some of the earliest public housing flats in Falkirk designed by someone who was a son of a famous ironfounder family, started as an ironfounder at the Salton foundry - and patented, and sold to the Coalbrookdale foundry, an innovative smoke consuming cooker design in 1910 - who trained as an architect and became the Burgh Engineer c1910-35. His father John Edward managed Camelon Iron Co. until he founded the Salton foundry in c1894. He was a leading force for education and led a campaign for a school of art and design in Falkirk, c1878. John's wife, and William's mother, Harriette Gibson led the Ironfounder campaign for the first public general hospital in Falkirk. Salton or Falkirk Cottage Infirmary which opened in 1889. Harriette was also an active ironfounder and managed Salton foundry with her son William. Tow of her other sons Robert (Ironfounder) and John (Civil engineer in concrete) would find solid fame and fortune in Melbourne, Australia, c1910-30.

Continuing North and after the next crossing any right turn takes you to towards Dawson Park, donated and opened for public use by the Dawson family of Carron Co. in 1904. In its  middle is a roadway which has at its centre two attractive decorative iron bollards and the remainder of a public drinking water fountain. At the far end of the park, on Haugh St., is a restored K6 phone kiosk, originally adopted by the Bainsford war Memorial Ass, but which is now in the care of the Friends of Dawson Park. It must be the closest K6 to its origin at Carron Co.'s Mungal foundry, which was just across the other side of Carron Rd.

![Carron works c1938](Carron-works-1938)

Follow Carron Road and bear left on the old road to Carron works on Stenhouse Road. Here you have three options:

1. The clock tower a remnant of the front building which contains a selection of Carronade guns and historic artifacts implanted it its external wall, a part of an original steam engine cylinder made for James Watt in 1766 and an original part of the first furnace made in 1760. A modern wall plaque recalls a visit made to the foundry by Robert Burns. The arch contains four guns also know as Carronades, two long barrel artillery pieces and two smaller 'smashers' for use on ships. The legend is that Nelson used similar at Trafalgar and Welligton at Waterloo. In Nelson's era ships fought at close quarters blasting each other at short range. 

Pics of Arch & Carronades

2. If you venture to follow the river Carron upriver the Grahamston Arch can be found. It was saved and resited here by Carron Phoenix at its works entrance c2002. It is now joined (Summer 12025) by The Carron Phoenix K6 phone box with display information on the Arch and Carron Co.'s many achievements.

Pic of Carron Phoenic K6 and Arch. 

3. The Carron Dams are at the back of the works, accessed either by continuing to follow the river or by walking around the large works wall and follow the Stenhouse Rd. which leads to Stenhousemuir. The Dams are a wild natural environment so take good boots. Originally created to supply Carron Co. with a reliable supply of water which powered the iron works prior to the success of Watt's highly efficient steam engine c1790s.

![Carron dams](Carron-dams)

Stenhousemuir is next on the map: The Tryst K6 at the junction of King St. and Central Drive. To get to that follow Stenhouse Rd. to the junction with Main St./King St. and turn right. This Carron Co. K6 is dated 1949 with a display of three parts:

1. Achievers who were trained at Carron Co. and went on to fame and fortune;
2. In introduction to Ironhearts of Iron Town story;
3. Artwork by Larbert High School students on the subject of iron foundry products and the Bruce Obelisk in Larbert Old Church kirkyard.

Next on the map, off Main st, is the life size Tryst Highland Cattle sculptures, designed by Alan Potter, and made in cast iron by Ballantine Castings in Bo'ness, 2016. Stenhousemuir was a tryst or hub for cattle trading 1785-1900. To get there, go back along King St. down Hallam St, toward Main St.  The next location, is on the Dobbie Hall is on Main Street. The hall and library was built by Major Robert Dobbie of the Dobbie Forbes Larbert foundry in Larbert 1870-2001, he gifted it for public use. Internally the hall has attractive decorations and features. The front doors has an exceptional wrought ironwork bracing design. It is still a popular local community asset used by many local groups and shows many operas and musical dramas.

Transport will be needed to make the next location, Letham Village, between Bellsdyke Rd, Larbert, and Airth. Built by Carron Co. as Miners row cottages for a local coal mine c1913-22. It is now a Council owned conservation housing area. An example of enlightened worker housing in the spirit of the garden suburb movement.

Next back to Larbert Cross to Larbert Old Church kirkyard where sits a recently renovated gem of Ironheart, the James Bruce Obelisk made by Carron Co. c1785, perhaps the first example of decorative ironwork made for private commission of the Industrial Revolution. Designed in the style of Robert & John Adam by William Haworth. It was made for his wife, Mary Dundas, as a lost love memorial and can be considered with the same meaning as the Taj Mahal. The kirkyard is also of Ironheart interest. Here are buried many of the cast iron leaders of the Industrial revolution including The Carron Co. enclosure. (A trip to Carriden kirkyard Bo'ness is required to view the grave of Prof John Roebuck one of the founders of Carron Co). The Kirkyard has an exceptional amount of cast iron grave markers many of them made by George Smith's Sun foundry, a leading decorative art iron foundry in the 19th century. Smith learned his as a patternmaker skills at Carron Co.

A distant trip to Denny is next, turn left out of the kirkyard onto the Denny Rd., into Denny, then left at Denny Cross, on the right opposite the Sainsbury's supermarket, is the attractive office block, 1914, of the Cruikshanks Denny foundry 1863-1984, associated with cutting edge farming tools and laterally specialist engineering iron and steel. 
Finally continue on the glasgow Road past the Head of Muir K6 phone kiosk (BT owned) and eventually left into Bonnybridge Rd. Then into the town and left at the roundabout up to the canal crossing and on the right can be seen the office block of the Smith & Wellstood foundry, origin of the Esse heat storage cooker. In this High Bonnybridge area are many remnants of iron foundry buildings further up on the left leads to the large scattered Chattan foundry site, now mainly used by motor related engineering firms and HQ of Central Demolition.

You can pick and choose what locations you visit, essentially the Ironheart map is an introduction to a surprising number of surviving buildings and artifacts in the Falkirk area. The addition of displays in K6s and the Ironheart mural and iron art sculpture garden are recent developments carried out voluntarily by Falkirk Made Friends in 2019, in partnership with local firms and Falkirk Council. One way of explaining the significane of the acheivements of the Falkirk area iron foundries is to read the story 'The Ironhearts of Irontown':

![Ironheart booklet](Ironheart-booklet-2024)
The idea of Ironheart as communicated through a fantastic story: 
Ironheart & the Ironhearts of Irontown: The Phoenix Awakes, is a fantastic story which offers an alternative means of telling the meaning of Ironheart. its multiple layers of meaning about the products associated with Irontown offers a variety of ways of comprehending the achievements of Ironheart.
