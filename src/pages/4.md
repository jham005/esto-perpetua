## The revolutionary achievements of Ironheart

It may be a grand claim, but Carron Company can be considered to be the first planned modern foundry in the world. It is often stated, by leading historians, that it was the origin of the Industrial Revolution in Scotland, when it started in 1759. However it is also possible to maintain that it was the first modern foundry in the World. Although the 1760s saw the rise of other large foundry concerns, none had the sheer scale of Carron Co's ambitious plans for making so many products that would add a new domestic product, with a consequent improvemnt in public health, dimension to the the Industrial Revolution.

It is not surprising then that their engineers and ironfounders were sought after.  These skilled workers were at the cutting edge of new ideas about industrial production, with rare large foundry experience of mass production casting skills, and water and steam power engineering experience, skills which were in short supply and thus at a premium demand. Carron Company was also the first cast iron foundry and largest employer in the Falkirk area, growing quickly to some 2,000 workers, also arguably the biggest foundry in Britain in the 1760s. Consequently it was the the source of ambitious entrepreneurial engineers who would open their own local foundries and turn both Falkirk into a national hub for cast iron light castings, used for domestic improvement, but also radiate innovative engineers across the world. 

The Iron Revolutionaries: The Industrial Revolution is Spread Across the World via Carron Co and the Ironheart Foundries:

Carron Co.'s skilled ironfounders and engineers would be highly valued by rulers, politicians and businessmen, who wanted to establish the latest engineering technology in their owweaves n country, initially this was in Russia and Eastern Europe c1780-1830. An Eastern European Carron Co linked thread can be followed from Charles Gascoigne 1737-1806, through John Baildon, 1772-1846, George Sherriff, 1768-1843, Charles Baird, 1767-1843, and Andrew Handyside 1806-1887.
The dynamic, but errant, Casgoigne was the manager of Carron Co who supplied Russia with western technology sending equipment, and skilled engineers over to equip it with foundry skills and steam engines. He eventually fled to Russia leaving his debts behind and gaining many rewards in Russia, yet he turned up the heat on the Industrial Revolution in Eastern Europe. Baildon, Sherriff Baird and Handyside would all benefit from working in Europe. 

John Baildon, Larbert born and Carron Co trained, fired up the Industrial Revolution in Prussian Sliesia, now Poland. As well as building many foundries, particulary in Gliwice, he was an early example of a civil engineer, designing the first iron bridge at Laasan 1794-6, and The Klodnica Canal 46km long 1792-1812; He also installed the first steam engine used in Germany at the Royal Porcelain Factory, Berlin, 1800-1824.

Charles Baird would also extend into civil engineering and start the first steamship ferry in Russia, from St Petersburg to Kronstadt in 1815. Baird employed the Handyside brothers. Andrew Handyside returned to the UK and seeing a gap in the midlands, and in 1848 buy the Brittania Foundry in Derby and start making h a name for his foundry as railway suppliers. Coincidentally he was the first Ironheart to win a Generla Post Office contract, in 1887, to supply pillar letter boxes.    

George Sherriff, built steam engines for the Russian Czar, and gained enough money to return to Falkirk and start the second foundry in Falkirk. Sherriff's Dalderse Foundry on Bankside was the first local competitor to Carron Co, which would break the mould and encourage other ambitious Carron Co tranied ironfoundersto start there own foundries in Falkirk and elsewhere. 

The revolutionaries also apread wider than Europe: To Norway went Thomas Cranford making a name for himself at the Naes Jernwerk Foundry c1800s. To America went Henry Burden emigrated to America in 1819 at the age of twenty eight. His energy and inventive saw him rise through the ranks and become manager then owner of his own foundry in Troy, New York State. He was an innovative inventor and used his knowledge of ironfounding and water power - a combination only used by carron Co in Scotland - to become a success. At his most ambitious he tried and failed, perhaps inspired by Baird's example, to set up a steam ferry between Britain and New York, yet when he applied his inventive genius to railway spike and horseshoe manufacturer he raced ahead of his competitors and made mass production machinery work. There is a Henry Burden Iron Museum in Troy today. The Pittsburg link is less well documented - steel became king there -  but the Shaw Brothers left Carron Co c1787 and started the earliest iron foundry there. Another Scot to arrive there was Joseph McClurg who started the Fort Pitt Foundry c1804. I'm sure furtehr research will unearth mmore American finds.

The Gibson Revolution: 

Sir Robert Gibson of the Camelon Foundry has already been mentioned, but the Gibson family also deserve some consideration. Robert's father aand mother were also significant Ironheart radicals. John Edward Gibson manager of Camelon Iron Co and then the Salton Foundry and Harriette Hickes Gibson were active in promting public good. John led a campaign for a Science and Art school which opened in park street in 1878. This provided modern scientific training and artistic design practice for the education of employees of local industries including the iron industry. John and the Falkirk iron industry would fully support Harriette when she became the lead campaiigner for improved public health care in Falkirk. She was sat the forefront of a period of dramtic change in attitudes towards health care. From 1885 she gained, first a home visiting nurse; was secretary of the local, and newly established, St Andrew's Ambulance association; set up a branch of the Queen's Nursing Institute, est 1889, to support professional training for nurses. Her stand-out public achievement was to lead a public campaign to fund a Falkirk's first general hospital, which based in Salton Cottage, Thornhill rd, opened in 1889. Her youngest son William helped Harriette run the salton Foundry after her husband died in 1898 until c1910, William a Glasgow School of Art trained architect, was appointed Falkirk Burgh Surveyer and engineer c1912-38 and in effect continued his father and Mothers public health concerns. In his role as burgh engineer he took part in designing many public health buildings, Council flats and houses, public wash houses ( Nailer Rd, Camelon, still present), Dawson Park Pavilion, the radical Larbert colony at the Royal Scottish national Institution Bellsdyke Hosital and the design layout of the new Falkirk and District Royal Infirmary at Major's Loan which open in 1932. A family of revolutionaries who helped transform social attitudes by practical effort and good design.               

The Revolutionaries of Decorative Iron: 

In Scotland, in this early Carron Co dominated era, one of the outstanding successes is George Smith, the former Carron Co trained pattermaker, who set up the Sun Foundry in Port Dundas in 1858, Glasgow, and became famous for ornate decorative iron structures including bandstand and water fountains. An exceptional example is the Coats Fountain in Paisley. It was installed, 1868, as an attraction in a public park as part of an effort to improve the local environment. Mo expense was spared by Thomas Coats, the fountain is ringed with large walruses and at the centre are figures and Herons surrounded by a seemingly endless number of water spouts. Arguably, one of the most unusual decorative ironworks made in Scotland.
 

![CoatsSunFountain, Paisley](SunFoundryPaisley)

The Sun Foundry was part of a new trend in in the iron industry,c1850s onwards, the production of public utilities in decorative iron. Two foundries would lead this charge Walter Macfarlane's Saracen Foundry, founded in 1849, first based in the Calton area, then moved to large new foundry in Possilpark in 1872, North Glasgow, and the Lion Foundry of Kirkintilloch. Proximity to the rapidly expanding Glasgow gave them access to a huge market for decorative iron. Prior to this Carron Co had decided as early as 1800 to reduce its participation in this market and concentrate on light castings eg water pipes, cookers, fireplaces, pots and pans. By the 1890s, with a few exceptions the decorative market was dominated by Saracen and Lion. Walter Macfarlane was a jeweller turned ironfounder, bringing an interest in attractive design and employing his staff from the Ironheart foundries. One of them Robert Hudson was Falkirk trained, at the Abbots Foundry, yet he was highly ambitious and with a creative desire to make decorative iron. He first moved to the Sun Foundry then, as it declined, to Walter Macfarlane's Saracen Foundry in Possillpark, to be arguably the largest modern decorative iron foundry in the world. Here he met up with two other frustrated employess and in 1880 they started the Lion Foundry in direct competition with their old employer. Hudson would lead the foundry to become a major success in decorative iron, and many of their showpiece shop fronts can still be seen decorating the High Streets of Britain, as well as their fountains and bandstands. Hudson's Lion foundry, the Sun and the Saracen Foundry, added attractive features to public life, bandstands and water fountains as well as being useful public utilities are celebrated and those that remain are now being prized. These two foundires were selected by the GPO to make phone kiosks. The Lion also made letter boxes. Some speculation on why the Saracen did not win any letterbox contracts is considered in an earlier chapter.     


The Revolutionaries of Allied Ironfounders 1929-69: 
The first two chairmen of Allied Ironfounders were radical improvers. James Shaw an ex-Smith and Wellstood employee who would run the Planet Foundry in Manchester, and was chairman of the radical combine Allied Ironfounders in 1942-53. He followed on from another Falkirk ironfounder ALexander Steven of McDowall, Steven & Co, who was chairman 1928-42.

![Portrait of Ida Tindall] (AIIdaTindall)

Alexander Steven and then James Shaw led Allied Ironfounders, from 1929, into being a driving force for new innovative domestic products. In products, Steven, for the success of the Aga, and Shaw for the Rayburn cooker and the development of a range of efficient home or space heating stoves. During Shaw's AI era, many daring projects were undertaken: Postwar a train with two adapted carriages was laid out to display new products and tour the land. Ideas that al;so aimed at improved public health, communicated by film in the cinema carriage. Also a nationwide campaign as conducted to find the universal housewife, a Mrs Great Britain, and selected was Mrs Ida Tindall of Hull, a factory worker who had been an air raid warden during the war. Her portrait was included in the carriage exhibition and is now in the Ferens Art Gallery, Hull. Shaw was also responsible for a practical housing experiment called the Stockton Test in 1953. The Scheme was that AI purchase four terraced houses, in a typical Stockton on Tees street and then modernise them with the latest kitchen and bathroom fittings. It was an attempt to encourage Councils to upgrade old property and preserve communities, rather than knock it down and disperse established neighbourhoods. In Shaw's era AI also began considering the future of the historic site at Coalbrookdale, which would lead to the saving of the Darby furnace and the establishment of a Museum of Iron which had a grand opening in 1959. It is worth noting that AI and its friends in the iron industry funded all these projects.    

The Revolution in Falkirk, the Consequence: The Rise of Ironheart:

However, locally, in the Falkirk area one of these ex Carron Co. engineers came back and started the first competitor to Carron Co: It had no competitors for 45 years, until the newly wealthy George Sherriff returned from his ironfounding work in Russia, and started the Dalderse foundry, in 1804. The foundry was the first to be sited so to use the new canal as a transport facility, based on the north side of the newly completed Forth & Clyde canal, and set an example to others of fearless independence. But for this, Falkirk could easily have became a Carron Company town. However the opposite happened, the Falkirk area would be the iron version of a gold rush town, but over a longer period, its foundries expanding and contracting depending on the market demand for its specialist domestic products. 

Competition can be the spur to innovation. Dalderse evolved by 1819, into Falkirk Iron Works - eventually Falkirk Iron Company - which would always maintain a competitive attitude to Carron Co: it is recorded in the Castings Cricket Club jubilee booklet 1899-1949 that Carron was the 'Auld Enemy' of Falkirk Iron Co. A competitive edge that endured and on one hand stimulated competition and on the other kept them from helping each other. The tension dates back to the origin of Falkirk Iron Works, when Carron Co tried using legel means to prevent their former staff from setting up an independent foundry. However, the benefits were that a doubling of the foundries, and their potential innovation, then meant even more skilled and ambitious engineers came to the fore, and the area eventually became a hub of specialist skills and innovation in kitchen range cookers and hot water heating, and consequently contributed directly in social progress with the improvement in personal health and cleanliness. Over the next one hundred years arose some sixty foundries, all engaged in making better cookers and hot water heaters. 

The  Revolutionary Cookers: The American Portable Cooker.

Some of the most radical developments included the success of the portable American kitchen range cooker, c1850s, (developed in America for easy transportation for settlers) which was first developed in Britain by Smith & Wellstood, based in Bonnybridge. Its foundry success was led by George Ure, a Carron Co. trained grate fitter, managed by James Smith a remarkable self-promoter and publicist.
Smith had an eventful life, and was one for hair-raising experiences including his survival of a shipwreck in the Atlantic Ocean. He created a raft from some wreckage including a large laundry wicker basket which he slept in, he survived by communing with porpoises. The wicker basket can still be seen at the Ouzledale Foundry along with his nightshirt. The porpoise became the emblem of the Smith family and Smith & Wellstood. 
The lighter weight and portability appeal of the American cooker ensured a demand which fuelled the origin of many new foundries including the Carron Co; Dobbie Forbes; Jones & Campbell; Lane & Girvan; Union; Camelon; Salton; Carron Co; Etna; Scottish Central etc. Thus Ironheart became a competitive centre of cooker innovation, which led to the development of the alternative gas and electric powered cookers. Gas cooker were a particular favourite of the Camelon area foundries including; Forth & Clyde and Sunnyside, and R&A Main. Falkirk Iron Co and Carron Co became leading makers of electric cookers. It is claimed that Carron Co was arguably the first foundry in the world to produce an electric cooker c1910.

The ease of transportation in the Falkirk area was also an attraction, many foundries were based along the banks of the Forth & Clyde canal, which enabled easy access to shipping at Grangemouth, Bo'ness and Glasgow, but when the railways arrived locations further afield began appearing. Blooming as a skill hub in light castings the Falkirk area would be home to over sixty different foundries, often specialising domestic cooking and heating goods, including traditional solid fuel cast iron fitted range cookers, and portable cooker versions, modern gas and electric cookers, water boiler and room heating stoves, bathtubs, domestic rainwater and sanitation drainage. Such was the areas skills base that at least two foundries moved from Glasgow: McDowall, Steven & Co to Laurieston c1904 and Waton,Gow & Co at the Etna Foundry on Bankside, c1874. As well as domestic goods many foundries sought diversity of products: General Post Office contracts were won: From 1904 McDowall Steven & Co. and from 1922 Carron Co. made letter boxes, and from 1926 telephone kiosks; Singer sewing machines and piano frames were made by George Ure of the Union Foundry, c1860, then later at Smith & Wellstood in Bonnybridge; Falkirk Iron Co. specialised in decorative iron art sculptures and vitreous enamel signage; Grahamston Iron Co. gained fame for its decorative arches, c1886; Cruikshank's in Denny became specialists in cast steel alloys for use in agriculture and engineering; Robert Taylor's, 1920s, of Larbert, became design leaders in solid fuel domestic hot water boilers. All were open to one off and unusual orders: Carron Co. reproduced Carronades in the 1970s; Robert Taylor's and Specialised Castings made sculptures for the artists Eduardo Paolozzi and Anthony Gormley; Carron Co. made tunnel lining segments for the Clyde and Tyne tunnels c1959-64.

## Local foundries today

Until recently there were two foundries in the falkirk area: Sadly the oldest, Ballantine Castings in Bo'ness, went into liquidation in August, yet Drysdale Brothers bronze foundry in Stenhousemuir has expanded. Ballantines were a large old general foundry and have made decorative castings for Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Drysdale's has its origins in Weir Pumps, but which now independently specialises in high quality bronze castings. Slightly further afield are Laing's foundry in Lochgelly a long established family concern, a general castings foundry but with a special knowledge of decorative castings, which enthusiastically support FMF by making for us frypans, bathtubs and the Burn's heads from Tam O'Shanter. Others include: another family business, Archibald Young's in Kirkintilloch, a town which was also a smaller concentrated hub of iron foundries including the famous Lion Foundry; and the ultra modern Taylor's of Hamilton, both are custom made suppliers to the engineering industry. 

## Ironheart foundries and bathtubs 
Revolutions continued.
The Iron Revolution in Personal Hygene: Keeping it Hot and Clean in Ironheart. 
From the 1860s the complexity of casting a large cast iron bath was solved and Carron Co. led the way. Initially this was a luxury market because the idea of a bathroom was only possible for the wealthy. However as the century progressed the bathroom with bathtub became a new standard feature and by the 1920s it was included in the new public housing schemes. The bath has become a basic essential of modern domestic life. However it had to be matched with innovative stove engineering which supplied enough hot water to fill a bath. The Ironheart foundries came to the rescue on both counts: Firstly the kitchen range was also made a hot water boiler, then separate heating and hot water stoves - also used as rubbish incinerators - were developed. A multiple variety of stoves becoming common in new homes from the c1890s. As the 1950s cartoon reveals, the Tayco range of hot water boiler stoves adopts the social consequences of innovation as labour saving liberators in the domestic home. In addition, better water supply and safe drainage was required, again Ironheart did the business supplying cast iron pipes for water supply, rainwater and sanitation drainage. Those unsung heroes, cast iron cisterns, provided an exceptional, or 'Perfect', power of water to flush away unwanted toilet waste. Se Carron Co catalogue image.

Ironheart Bathtub Time.
By chance a small green cast iron bathtub was found in a Glasgow antiques shop. It was a Cockburn's Gowanbank Foundry sales rep' sample for vitreous enamel finishes. It was used as the basis of a pattern to make new versions, in out an of the mould cast iron finish, available to order, see last page. The Ironheart foundries had by 1920 became a national hub for bath production and would supply many of the bathtubs fitted as standard in new Council housing in the post-WW2 period. The bathtub was transformed from a luxury item to a basic necessity of contemporary public health standards. Again a local foundry came to our aid - Laing's in Lochgelly -  and the mini bathtub was added to the growing list of Ironheart products.

As well as leading the Industrial Revolution Ironheart took part in another dramatic social development, a domestic living standard revolution, which transformed public expectations of home heating, cooking, cleanliness and sanitation. Its Kitchen range, or cooker, and home heater, hot water boilers, rainwater and sewage drainage would forever transform domestic living standards.

 Ordering a cast iron frypan or/and a mini bathtub is a direct way of connecting with these achievements.
 These Ironhearts are made from recycled local scrap iron from broken phone kiosks, cookers and fireplaces etc.
 Frypan: Cooking on cast iron the K6 way.
 Bathtub: Bathing for the fingers.
