title: Ironheart Cleaning Up, An Outline of its Progress and How it Heated up a Domestic Revolution
---
The Revolutionary achievements of Ironheart:
It may be a grand claim, but Carron Company can be considered the first planned modern foundry in the world. It is often stated, by leading historians, that it was the origin of the Industrial Revolution in Scotland, in 1759. However it is also possible to maintain that it was the first modern foundry in the World. Although the 1760s saw the rise of other large foundry concerns, none had the sheer scale of Carron Co's ambitious plans for making many products which added a new domestic product dimension to the the Industrial Revolution.

It is not surprising then that their engineers were sought after. They were at the cutting edge of new ideas about industrial production, with rare large foundry experience of powering a works, mass production casting skills, and water and steam power engineering experience, which were in short supply and thus a premium demand. Carron Company was also the first cast iron foundry and largest employer in the Falkirk area, growing quickly to some 2,000 workers, also arguably the biggest foundry in Britain in the 1760s. Consequently it was the the source of ambitious entrepreneurial engineers who would open their own local foundries and turn both Falkirk into a national hub for cast iron light castings, used for domestic improvement, but also radiate innovative engineers across the world.

Carron Co.'s skilled engineers would be head hunted by rulers, politicians and businessmen, who wanted to establish the latest engineering technology in their own country, initially this was in Russia and Eastern Europe c1780-1830. However, locally, in the Falkirk area one of these ex Carron Co. engineers came back and started the first competitor to Carron Co: It had no competitors for 45 years, until the newly wealthy George Sherriff returned from his ironfounding work in Russia, and started the Dalderse foundry, in 1804. The foundry was the first to be sited so to use the new canal as a transport facility, based on the north side of the newly completed Forth & Clyde canal, and set an example to others of fearless independence. But for this, Falkirk could easily have became a Carron Company town. However the opposite happened, the Falkirk area would be the iron version of a gold rush town, but over a longer period, its foundries expanding and contracting depending on the market demand for its domestic products.

Competition can be the spur to innovation. Dalderse evolved by 1819, into Falkirk Iron Works - eventually Falkirk Iron Company - which would always maintain a competitive attitude to Carron Co. (it is recorded in the Castings Cricket Club jubilee booklet 1899-1949 that Carron was the 'Auld Enemy' of Falkirk Iron Co.). A doubling of the foundries, and their potential innovation, then meant even more skilled and ambitious engineers came to the fore, and the area became a hub of specialist skills and innovation in kitchen range cookers and hot water heating, and consequently contributed directly in social progress with the improvement in personal health and cleanliness. Over the next one hundred years arose some sixty foundries, all engaged in making better cookers and hot water heaters. Some of the most radical developments included the success of the portable American kitchen range cooker, c1850s, (developed in America for transportation on settler wagon trains) which was first developed in Britain by Smith & Wellstood, based in Bonnybridge. Its foundry success was led by George Ure, a Carron Co. trained grate fitter, managed by James Smith a marketing genius. The lighter weight and possible portability appeal of the American portable cooker ensured a demand which fuelled the origin of many new foundries including the Union, Camelon, Grahamston and Cockburn's. Thus began the search for cooker innovation led to the development of the alternative gas and electric powered cookers. Gas cooker were a particular favourite of the Camelon area foundries including; Forth & Clyde and Sunnyside, and R&A Main.

The ease of transportation in the Falkirk area was also an attraction, many foundries were based along the banks of the Forth & Clyde canal, which enabled easy access to shipping at Grangemouth, Bo'ness and Glasgow, but when the railways arrived locations further afield began appearing. Blooming as a skill hub in light castings the Falkirk area would be home to over sixty different foundries, often specialising domestic cooking and heating goods, including traditional solid fuel cast iron fitted range cookers, and portable cooker versions, modern gas and electric cookers, water boiler and room heating stoves, bathtubs, domestic rainwater and sanitation drainage. Such was the areas skills base that at least two foundries moved from Glasgow, McDowall Steven and Etna. As well as domestic goods many foundries sought diversity of products: General Post Office contracts were won: From 1904 McDowall Steven & Co. and from 1922 Carron Co. made letter boxes and telephone kiosks; Singer sewing machines and piano frames were mad eby George Ure of the Union Foundry, c1860, then later at Smith & Wellstood in bonnybridge; Falkirk Iron Co. specialised in decorative iron art sculptures and vitreous enamel signage; Grahamston Iron Co. gained fame for its decorative arches, c1886; Cruikshank's in Denny became specialists in cast steel alloys for use in agriculture and engineering; Robert Taylor's, 1920s, of Larbert, became design leaders in solid fuel domestic hot water boilers. All were open to one off and unusual orders: Carron Co. reproduced Carronades in the 1970s; Taylor's and Specialised Castings made sculptures for the artists Eduardo Paolozzi and Anthony Gormley; Carron Co. made tunnel lining segments for the Clyde and Tyne tunnels c1959-64.

## Local foundries today

Two foundries remain in the falkirk area: Ballantine Castings in Bo'ness and Drysdale Brothers in Stenhousemuir. Ballantines are a large old general foundry and have made decorative castings for Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Drysdales has its origins in Weir Pumps, but which now independently specialises in high quality bronze castings. Slightly further afield are Laing's foundry in Lochgelly a long established family concern, which enthusiastically support FMF by making for us frypans, bathtubs and the Burn's heads from Tam O'Shanter. Others include: another family business, Archibald Young's in Kirkintilloch, a town which was also a concentrated hub of iron foundries including the famous Lion Foundry; and the ultra modern Taylor's of Hamilton, both are custom made suppliers to the engineering industry.

## Ironheart Foundries and Bathtubs

From the 1860s the complexity of casting a large cast iron bath was solved and Carron Co. led the way. Initially this was a luxury market because the idea of a bathroom was only possible for the wealthy. However as the century progressed the bathroom with bathtub became a new standard feature and by the 1920s it was included in the new public housing schemes. The bath has become a basic essential of modern domestic life. However it had to be matched with innovative stove engineering which supplied enough hot water to fill a bath. The Ironheart foundries came to the rescue on both counts: Firstly the kitchen range was also made a hot water boiler, then separate heating and hot water stoves - also used as rubbish incinerators - were developed. A multiple variety of stoves becoming common in new homes from the c1890s. As the cartoon indicates the Tayco range of hot water boiler stoves adopts the social consequences of innovation as labour saving liberators in the domestic home. In addition, water supply and drainage was required and again Ironheart did the business supplying cast iron pipes for water supply, rainwater and sanitation drainage. Those unsung heroes cast iron cisterns provided an exceptional, or 'Perfect', power of water to flush away unwanted toilet waste.

By chance a small green cast iron bathtub was found in a Glasgow antiques shop. It was a Cockburn's Gowanbank Foundry sales rep sample for vitreous enamel finishes. It is is now used as a pattern to make new versions in out of the mould cast iron finish available to order, see last page. The significance is that the Ironheart foundries had by 1920 became a national hub for bath production and would supply many of the bathtubs fitted as standard in new Council housing in the post-WW2 period. The bathtub was transformed from a luxury item to a basic necessity of contemporary public health standards. Again a local foundry came to our aid - Laing's in Lochgelly -  and the mini bathtub was added to the growing list of our Ironheart products.

As well as leading the Industrial Revolution Ironheart took part in another dramatic social development, a domestic living standard revolution, which transformed public expectations of home heating, cooking, cleanliness and sanitation. Its Kitchen range, or cooker, and home heater, hot water boilers, rainwater and sewage drainage would forever transform domestic living standards.

 Ordering a cast iron frypan or/and a mini bathtub is a direct way of connecting with these achievements.
 These Ironhearts are made from recycled local scrap iron from broken phone kiosks, cookers and fireplaces etc.
