title: 1.4: Ironheart, the collective contribution the Falkirk area foundries made to improving public health
---

As the Carron Company was the first cast iron foundry and largest employer in the Falkirk area, it was consequently the source of ambitious engineers who would open their own foundries and turn both Falkirk into a national hub for cast iron light castings, used for domestic improvement, but also radiate innovative engineers across the world. Carron Co. led the Industrial Revolution and was in 1759 the first planned large scale modern technical iron foundry in the world. Consequently their engineers were at the cutting edge of new ideas, with rare large foundry casting skills and water and steam power engineering experience which were in short supply and great demand.

Carron Co.'s ambitious iron founders would be head hunted by rulers, politicains and businessmen who wanted to establish the latest engineering technology in their own country, initially this was in Russia and Eastern Europe c1780-1830. However, locally, in the Falkirk area Carron Co. had no competitors for 45 years, until George Sherriff, one of those engineers, returned with wealth from his ironfounding work in Russia, established, in 1804, the Dalderse foundry, sited on the north side of the newly completed Forth & Clyde canal, as Carron Co.'s first local competitor.

Competition can be the spur to innovation. Dalderse evolved, by 1819, into Falkirk Iron Co. which would always maintain a competitive attitude to Carron Co ( it is recorded in the Castings Cricket Club jubilee booklet 1899-1949 that Carron was the 'Auld Enemy' of Falkirk Iron Co). A doubling of the foundries and their skills meant even more skiled and ambitious engineers came to the fore, and the area became a hub of specialist skills and innovation in kitchen range cookers and hot water heating, and consequently an improvement in personal health and cleanliness. Over the next one hundred years arise some sixty foundries, all engaged in making better cookers and hot water heaters. Some of the most radical developments included the success of the portable American kitchen range cooker, c1850s, (developed in America for transportation on settler wagon trains) first developed in Britain by Smith & Wellstood, based in Bonnybridge. Its foundry success was led by George Ure, a Carron Co. trained grate fitter. The ligter weight portability appeal of this cooker ensured a demand which fuelled the origin of many new foundries including the Union, Camelon, Grahamston, Cockburn's. The search for cooker innovation led to the development of gas and electric powered cookers, particularly in the Camelon area foundries including; Forth & Clyde and Sunnyside, and R&A Main.

The ease of transportation in teh Falkirkarea was also an attraction, many foundries initially based along the Forth & Clyde canal, which enabled access to shipping at Grangemouth, Bo'ness and Glasgow, but when the railways arrived locations further afield began appearing. Blooming as a skill hub in light castings the Falkirk area would be home to over sixty different foundries, mainly specialising in traditional solid fuel cast iron range cookers, portable cooker versions, modern gas and electric cookers, water boiler and room heating stoves, bathtubs and domestic rainwater and sanitation drainage. Many foundries also diversified: From 1904 McDowall Steven & Co and from 1922 Carron Co. made letter boxes and telephone kiosks; George Ure of Smith & Wellstood made Singer sewing machine bodies and piano frames, Falkirk Iron Co. made decorative iron and vitreous enamel signage, Grahamston Iron Co. became famous for its decorative arches; Cruikshank's in Denny became specialists in cast steel alloys for use in agriculture and engineering; Robert Taylor's, of Larbert, became design leaders in solid fuel domestic hot water boilers. All were open to one off and unusual orders: Taylor's and Specialised Castings made sculptures for the artists Eduardo Paolozzi and Anthony Gormley, Carron Co. made tunnel lining segments for the Clyde and Tyne tunnels.

Two foundries remain in Ironheart, Ballantine Castings in Bo'ness and Drysdale Brothers in Stenhousemuir. Ballantines are a general foundry and have made decorative castings for Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Drysdales has its origins in Weir Pumps, but which now independently specialises in high quality bronze castings. Slightly further afield are Laing's foundry in Lochgelly a long established family concern, which enthusiastically support FMF by making for us frypans, bathtubs and the Burn's heads from Tam O'Shanter. Others include another family business, Archibald Young's in Kirkintilloch, a town which was also a concentrated hub of iron foundries, and the ultra modern Taylor's of Hamilton, both are general suppliers to the engineering industry.

By chance a small green cast iron bathtub was found in a Glasgow antiques shop. It was a Cockburn's Gowanbank Foundry sales rep sample for vitreous enamel finishes. It is is now used as a pattern to amke new versions in out of the mould cast iron finish available to order, see last page. The significane is that the Ironheart foundries had by 1920 became a national hub for bath production and would supply many of teh bathtubs fitted as satndard in new Council housing in the post-WW2 period. The bathtub was transformed from a luxury item to a basic neccessity of contemporary public health standards. The bathtub was added to the growing list of Ironheart products: Kitchen range or cooker home heater, hot water boilers, rainwater and sewage drainage, which would transform domestic living standards.
