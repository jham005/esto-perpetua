title: 1.4: Ironheart Cleaning Up, An Outline of its Progress and How it Heated up a Domestic Revolution:
---
The Revolutionary achievements of Ironheart:
It may be a grand claim, but Carron Company can claim to be the first planned modern foundry in the world. It is aften satted that it was the origin of the Industrial Revolution in Scotland, in 1759. However it is also possible to claim that it was the first modern foundry in the World. Although the 1760s saw the rise of large foundries, the sheer scale of Carron Co's ambitious plans for making many products added a new doemstic product dimension to the the Industrial Revolution.   
It is not surprising that their engineers were sought after. They were at the cutting edge of new ideas, with rare large foundry experience of powering a works, mass production casting skills, and water and steam power engineering experience, which were in short supply and thus a premium demand. Carron Company was also the first cast iron foundry and largest employer in the Falkirk area, growing quickly to some 2,000 workers, also arguably the biggest foundry in Britain in the 1760s. Consequently it was the the source of ambitious entrepreneurial engineers who would open their own foundries and turn both Falkirk into a national hub for cast iron light castings, used for domestic improvement, but also radiate innovative engineers across the world.

Carron Co.'s skilled engineers would be head hunted by rulers, politicians and businessmen, who wanted to establish the latest engineering technology in their own country, initially this was in Russia and Eastern Europe c1780-1830. However, locally, in the Falkirk area one fo these ex Carron Co engineers came abck and start ted teh first competitor to Carron Co. It had no competitors for 45 years, until the newly wealthy George Sherriff returned from his ironfounding work in Russia, and started the Dalderse foundry, in 1804. The foundry was teh fisrt to be sited to use the new canal as a transport facility, based on the north side of the newly completed Forth & Clyde canal, and set an example of fearless independence. But for this, Falkirk coudl easily have became Carron Co company town. Hwever the opposite happened over a period of one hudred years the Falkirk area would be the iron version of a gold rush town.

Competition can be the spur to innovation. Dalderse evolved, by 1819, into Falkirk Iron Co. which would always maintain a competitive attitude to Carron Co ( it is recorded in the Castings Cricket Club jubilee booklet 1899-1949 that Carron was the 'Auld Enemy' of Falkirk Iron Co). A doubling of the foundries and their skills meant even more skilled and ambitious engineers came to the fore, and the area became a hub of specialist skills and innovation in kitchen range cookers and hot water heating, and consequently an improvement in personal health and cleanliness. Over the next one hundred years arise some sixty foundries, all engaged in making better cookers and hot water heaters. Some of the most radical developments included the success of the portable American kitchen range cooker, c1850s, (developed in America for transportation on settler wagon trains) first developed in Britain by Smith & Wellstood, based in Bonnybridge. Its foundry success was led by George Ure, a Carron Co. trained grate fitter. The ligter weight portability appeal of this cooker ensured a demand which fuelled the origin of many new foundries including the Union, Camelon, Grahamston, Cockburn's. The search for cooker innovation led to the development of gas and electric powered cookers, particularly in the Camelon area foundries including; Forth & Clyde and Sunnyside, and R&A Main.

## Ironheart Turning up the Heat With Tasty Cookers:

The ease of transportation in the Falkirk area was also an attraction, many foundries initially based along the Forth & Clyde canal, which enabled access to shipping at Grangemouth, Bo'ness and Glasgow, but when the railways arrived locations further afield began appearing. Blooming as a skill hub in light castings the Falkirk area would be home to over sixty different foundries, often specialising in cookers icluding traditional solid fuel cast iron fitted range cookers, and portable cooker versions, modern gas and electric cookers, water boiler and room heating stoves, bathtubs, domestic rainwater and sanitation drainage. Many foundries also diversified: From 1904 McDowall Steven & Co and from 1922 Carron Co. made letter boxes and telephone kiosks; George Ure of the Union Foundry, and later Smith & Wellstood, made Singer sewing machine bodies and piano frames, Falkirk Iron Co. made decorative iron art sculptures and vitreous enamel signage, Grahamston Iron Co. became famous for its decorative arches; Cruikshank's in Denny became specialists in cast steel alloys for use in agriculture and engineering; Robert Taylor's, of Larbert, became design leaders in solid fuel domestic hot water boilers. All were open to one off and unusual orders: Taylor's and Specialised Castings made sculptures for the artists Eduardo Paolozzi and Anthony Gormley; Carron Co. made tunnel lining segments for the Clyde and Tyne tunnels.

# Local Foundries Today:

Two foundries remain in Ironheart, Ballantine Castings in Bo'ness and Drysdale Brothers in Stenhousemuir. Ballantines are a general foundry and have made decorative castings for Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Drysdales has its origins in Weir Pumps, but which now independently specialises in high quality bronze castings. Slightly further afield are Laing's foundry in Lochgelly a long established family concern, which enthusiastically support FMF by making for us frypans, bathtubs and the Burn's heads from Tam O'Shanter. Others include another family business, Archibald Young's in Kirkintilloch, a town which was also a concentrated hub of iron foundries, and the ultra modern Taylor's of Hamilton, both are general suppliers to the engineering industry.

# Ironheart Foundries and Bathtubs

From the 1860s the complexity of casting a large cast iron bath was solved and Carron Co led the way. Initially this was a luxury market because the idea of a bathroom was only possible for the wealthy. However as the century progressed the bathroom with bathtub became a new standard feature and by the 1920s it was included in the new public housing schemes. The bath had became a basic essential of modern domestic life. However it had to be matched with innovative stove engineering which supplied enough hot water. The Ironheart foundries came to the rescue on both counts: Firstly the kitchen range was also made a hot water boiler, then separate heating and hot water stoves - also used as rubbish incinerators - were developed. A multiple of stoves becoming common in new homes from the c1890s. As the cartoon indicates the Tayco range of hot water boiler stoves being one of the labour saving liberators in the domestic home. In addition water supply and drainage was required and again Ironheart did the business supplying cast iron pipes for water supply, rainwater and sanitation drainage. Those unsung heroes cast iron cisterns provided an exceptional power of water to flush away unwanted toilet waste.

By chance a small green cast iron bathtub was found in a Glasgow antiques shop. It was a Cockburn's Gowanbank Foundry sales rep sample for vitreous enamel finishes. It is is now used as a pattern to make new versions in out of the mould cast iron finish available to order, see last page. The significance is that the Ironheart foundries had by 1920 became a national hub for bath production and would supply many of the bathtubs fitted as standard in new Council housing in the post-WW2 period. The bathtub was transformed from a luxury item to a basic necessity of contemporary public health standards. Again a local foundry came to our aid - Laing's in Lochgelly -  and the mini bathtub was added to the growing list of our Ironheart products.

Ironheart took part in another Revolution, a domestic living standard revolution, which transformed expectation of home heating, cooking, cleanliness and sanitation. Its Kitchen range or cooker home heater, hot water boilers, rainwater and sewage drainage, which would forever transform domestic living standards.

 Ordering a cast iron frypan or/and a mini bathtub is a direct way of connecting with these achievements.
