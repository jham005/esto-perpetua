## The revolutionary achievements of Ironheart

It may be a grand claim, but Carron Company can be considered to be the first planned modern foundry in the world. It is often stated, by leading historians, that it was the origin of the Industrial Revolution in Scotland, when it started in 1759. However it is also possible to maintain that it was the first modern foundry in the World. Although the 1760s saw the rise of other large foundry concerns, none had the sheer scale of Carron Co's ambitious plans for making so many products that would add a new domestic product, with a consequent improvemnt in public health, dimension to the the Industrial Revolution.

It is not surprising then that their engineers and ironfounders were sought after.  These skilled workers were at the cutting edge of new ideas about industrial production, with rare large foundry experience of mass production casting skills, and water and steam power engineering experience, skills which were in short supply and thus at a premium demand. Carron Company was also the first cast iron foundry and largest employer in the Falkirk area, growing quickly to some 2,000 workers, also arguably the biggest foundry in Britain in the 1760s. Consequently it was the the source of ambitious entrepreneurial engineers who would open their own local foundries and turn both Falkirk into a national hub for cast iron light castings, used for domestic improvement, but also radiate innovative engineers across the world. 
The Industrial Revolution is Spread across the World via Carron Co and the Ironheart foundries: The Iron Revolutionaries. 
Carron Co.'s skilled ironfounders and engineers would be highly valued by rulers, politicians and businessmen, who wanted to establish the latest engineering technology in their owweaves n country, initially this was in Russia and Eastern Europe c1780-1830. An Eastern European Carron Co linked thread can be followed from Charles Gascoigne through John Baildon 1772-1846 George Sherriff 1768-1843, Charles Baird, 1767-, and Andrew Handyside 1806-1887.   
ANother thread to unroll would be in North America eg Pittsburg and Troy.
Or Thomas Cranford to Norway to Henry Burden in America. George Smith in Glasgow, Robert Hudson in Kirkintilloch and James Shaw in Manchester  
John Baildon Larbert born and Carron Co trained, fired up the Industrial Revolution in Prussian Sliesia, now Poland. As well as building many foundries, particulary in Gliwice, he was an early example of a civil engineer, designing the first iron bridge at Laasan 1794-6, and The Klodnica Canal 46km long 1792-1812; He also installed the first steam engine used in Germany at the Royal Porcelain Factory, Berlin, 1800-1824.
George Sherriff 
Henry Burden emigrated to America in 1819 at the age of twenty eight. His energy and inventive saw him rise through the ranks and become manager then owner of his own foundry in Troy, New York State. 
The Revolution in Falkirk Shaped Ironheart: 
However, locally, in the Falkirk area one of these ex Carron Co. engineers came back and started the first competitor to Carron Co: It had no competitors for 45 years, until the newly wealthy George Sherriff returned from his ironfounding work in Russia, and started the Dalderse foundry, in 1804. The foundry was the first to be sited so to use the new canal as a transport facility, based on the north side of the newly completed Forth & Clyde canal, and set an example to others of fearless independence. But for this, Falkirk could easily have became a Carron Company town. However the opposite happened, the Falkirk area would be the iron version of a gold rush town, but over a longer period, its foundries expanding and contracting depending on the market demand for its specialist domestic products. 

Competition can be the spur to innovation. Dalderse evolved by 1819, into Falkirk Iron Works - eventually Falkirk Iron Company - which would always maintain a competitive attitude to Carron Co: it is recorded in the Castings Cricket Club jubilee booklet 1899-1949 that Carron was the 'Auld Enemy' of Falkirk Iron Co. A competitive edge that endured and on one hand stimulated competition and on the other kept them from helping each other. The tension dates back to the origin of Falkirk Iron Works, when Carron Co tried using legel means to prevent their former staff from setting up an independent foundry. However, the benefits were that a doubling of the foundries, and their potential innovation, then meant even more skilled and ambitious engineers came to the fore, and the area eventually became a hub of specialist skills and innovation in kitchen range cookers and hot water heating, and consequently contributed directly in social progress with the improvement in personal health and cleanliness. Over the next one hundred years arose some sixty foundries, all engaged in making better cookers and hot water heaters. Some of the most radical developments included the success of the portable American kitchen range cooker, c1850s, (developed in America for easy transportation for settlers) which was first developed in Britain by Smith & Wellstood, based in Bonnybridge. Its foundry success was led by George Ure, a Carron Co. trained grate fitter, managed by James Smith a remarkable self-promoter and publicist.
Smith had an eventful life, and was one for hair-raising experiences including his survival of a shipwreck in the Atlantic Ocean. He created a raft from some wreckage including a large laundry wicker basket which he slept in, he survived by communing with porpoises. The wicker basket can still be seen at the Ouzledale Foundry along with his nightshirt. The porpoise became the emblem of the Smith family and Smith & Wellstood. 
The lighter weight and portability appeal of the American cooker ensured a demand which fuelled the origin of many new foundries including the Carron Co; Dobbie Forbes; Jones & Campbell; Lane & Girvan; Union; Camelon; Salton; Carron Co; Etna; Scottish Central etc. Thus Ironheart became a competitive centre of cooker innovation, which led to the development of the alternative gas and electric powered cookers. Gas cooker were a particular favourite of the Camelon area foundries including; Forth & Clyde and Sunnyside, and R&A Main. Falkirk Iron Co and Carron Co became leading makers of electric cookers. It is claimed that Carron Co was arguably the first foundry in the world to produce an electric cooker c1910.

The ease of transportation in the Falkirk area was also an attraction, many foundries were based along the banks of the Forth & Clyde canal, which enabled easy access to shipping at Grangemouth, Bo'ness and Glasgow, but when the railways arrived locations further afield began appearing. Blooming as a skill hub in light castings the Falkirk area would be home to over sixty different foundries, often specialising domestic cooking and heating goods, including traditional solid fuel cast iron fitted range cookers, and portable cooker versions, modern gas and electric cookers, water boiler and room heating stoves, bathtubs, domestic rainwater and sanitation drainage. Such was the areas skills base that at least two foundries moved from Glasgow: McDowall, Steven & Co to Laurieston c1904 and Waton,Gow & Co at the Etna Foundry on Bankside, c1874. As well as domestic goods many foundries sought diversity of products: General Post Office contracts were won: From 1904 McDowall Steven & Co. and from 1922 Carron Co. made letter boxes, and from 1926 telephone kiosks; Singer sewing machines and piano frames were made by George Ure of the Union Foundry, c1860, then later at Smith & Wellstood in Bonnybridge; Falkirk Iron Co. specialised in decorative iron art sculptures and vitreous enamel signage; Grahamston Iron Co. gained fame for its decorative arches, c1886; Cruikshank's in Denny became specialists in cast steel alloys for use in agriculture and engineering; Robert Taylor's, 1920s, of Larbert, became design leaders in solid fuel domestic hot water boilers. All were open to one off and unusual orders: Carron Co. reproduced Carronades in the 1970s; Taylor's and Specialised Castings made sculptures for the artists Eduardo Paolozzi and Anthony Gormley; Carron Co. made tunnel lining segments for the Clyde and Tyne tunnels c1959-64.

## Local foundries today

Until August there were tow foundries in the falkirk area: Sadly the oldesd, Ballantine Castings in Bo'ness, went into liquidation in August, yet Drysdale Brothers bronze foundry in Stenhousemuir has expanded. Ballantines were a large old general foundry and have made decorative castings for Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament. Drysdales has its origins in Weir Pumps, but which now independently specialises in high quality bronze castings. Slightly further afield are Laing's foundry in Lochgelly a long established family concern, a general castings foundry but with a special knowledge of decorative castings, which enthusiastically support FMF by making for us frypans, bathtubs and the Burn's heads from Tam O'Shanter. Others include: another family business, Archibald Young's in Kirkintilloch, a town which was also a smaller concentrated hub of iron foundries including the famous Lion Foundry; and the ultra modern Taylor's of Hamilton, both are custom made suppliers to the engineering industry. 

## Ironheart foundries and bathtubs 
Revolutions continued.
The Iron Revolution in Personal Hygene: Keeping it Hot and Clean in Ironheart. 
From the 1860s the complexity of casting a large cast iron bath was solved and Carron Co. led the way. Initially this was a luxury market because the idea of a bathroom was only possible for the wealthy. However as the century progressed the bathroom with bathtub became a new standard feature and by the 1920s it was included in the new public housing schemes. The bath has become a basic essential of modern domestic life. However it had to be matched with innovative stove engineering which supplied enough hot water to fill a bath. The Ironheart foundries came to the rescue on both counts: Firstly the kitchen range was also made a hot water boiler, then separate heating and hot water stoves - also used as rubbish incinerators - were developed. A multiple variety of stoves becoming common in new homes from the c1890s. As the 1950s cartoon reveals, the Tayco range of hot water boiler stoves adopts the social consequences of innovation as labour saving liberators in the domestic home. In addition, betetr water supply and safe drainage was required, again Ironheart did the business supplying cast iron pipes for water supply, rainwater and sanitation drainage. Those unsung heroes, cast iron cisterns, provided an exceptional, or 'Perfect', power of water to flush away unwanted toilet waste. Se Carron Co catalogue image.

Ironheart Bathtub Time.
By chance a small green cast iron bathtub was found in a Glasgow antiques shop. It was a Cockburn's Gowanbank Foundry sales rep sample for vitreous enamel finishes. It was used as the basis of a pattern to make new versions, in out an of the mould cast iron finish, available to order, see last page. The Ironheart foundries had by 1920 became a national hub for bath production and would supply many of the bathtubs fitted as standard in new Council housing in the post-WW2 period. The bathtub was transformed from a luxury item to a basic necessity of contemporary public health standards. Again a local foundry came to our aid - Laing's in Lochgelly -  and the mini bathtub was added to the growing list of Ironheart products.

As well as leading the Industrial Revolution Ironheart took part in another dramatic social development, a domestic living standard revolution, which transformed public expectations of home heating, cooking, cleanliness and sanitation. Its Kitchen range, or cooker, and home heater, hot water boilers, rainwater and sewage drainage would forever transform domestic living standards.

 Ordering a cast iron frypan or/and a mini bathtub is a direct way of connecting with these achievements.
 These Ironhearts are made from recycled local scrap iron from broken phone kiosks, cookers and fireplaces etc.
 Frypan: Cooking on cast iron the K6 way.
 Bathtub: Bathing for the fingers.
