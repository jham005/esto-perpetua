Welcome to the Ironheart website: Falkirk Made Cast Iron Frypans, bathtubs, Robert Burns Heads and Ironhearts storybook...

![Ironheart and the Ironhearts of Irontown](Ironhearts)

This website has the aim of promoting the achievements of 'Ironheart' and stimulating interest in an industry which still has a purpose. The cast iron artifacts and booklet are ways to promote Ironheart and engage in practical ways to raise funds for campaigns by Falkirk Made Friends (FMF).

'Ironheart' is the collective term  for the achievements of the Falkirk area foundries and their International influence. A term created by Falkirk Made Friends to unite the many solid achievements - and the contribution to enabling new standards public health - of the some sixty plus Falkirk area foundries. The cast iron frying pan was one of the earliest products made in the Falkirk area by Carron Co., 1759-1982. The almost immediate consequence was to find a better way of using the frypan more efficiently, which led to the development from the open fire to the kitchen range cooker. Consequently, Ironheart would become a national and International hub turning up the heat on cooker innovation.

The poet Robert Burns was born the same year as Carron Co., 1759, and he lived through the rise of the foundry and interacted with it on many occasions. The maker of the Robert Burns wall sculptures is unknown at present but they are a solid Ironheart way of celebrating the Burns connections. Tam and Souter Johnnie are two characters from Burns narrative poem Tam O'Shanter, which has its origin by the heat of a revolutionary Carron Co. kitchen range (see Short video of part of the play on Tam). The mini bath tubs were sample models made by Cockburn's foundry for use by salesmen c1930s, originally coated in different colour shades of porcelain enamel. The Ironhearts of irontown storybook is an alternative way to tell of the achievements of Ironheart published in 2024. Information on how to order any of these artifacts can be found on the last page.

## 'Ironheart': What Does It Mean?

Carron Co. was the first Ironheart foundry - one of the first planned modern large scale foundry in the world Industrial Revolution - and would, as it was an innovative force of new technology, be the source of many generations of highly skilled, ambitious and motivated engineers who would both turn the Falkirk area into a world respected hub of innovative light cast iron products and educate and inspire foundry skills throughout the world. Although Carron Co. recruited its first ironfounders from Coalbrookdale it's large and planned scale signalled the start of a new ambitious and energetic stage in the Industrial revolution. Becoming itself a source of highly skilled and entrepreneuring skilled ironfounders who led Northern European countries to establish iron foundries and other engineering projects, see online article Carron Co. & Eastern Europe by Geoff Bailey by Falkirk Local History club. A later example of that world wide influence was Sir Robert Gibson 1863-1934, from the Camelon foundry, who continued the Ironheart tradition by making the unusual top burner Lux solid fuel cooker, in Melbourne, Australia. Sir Robert turned up the heat in another way as he also gained public notoriety for his cast iron will power as chairman of the National Bank of Australia during the 1929-34 economic depression, criticised, for his independent attitude to public spending, by both politicians and the press, he was a particular favourite subject of cartoonists.

The recent birth of the concept of 'Ironheart' focussed the  activities of Falkirk Made Friends on the realisation that the Falkirk area was an iron treasure trove of achievements, which transformed public health and domestic living conditions. Added to Carron Co's 'Esto Perpetua motto'; 'To Live Forever', is Falkirk Iron Co's 'Ferro Non Auro Mollescere Secula'; 'Iron, not gold, is the great civiliser'. These influenced an updated motto for FMF: 'Iron Is Falkirk's Gold'. A phrase that should encourage consideration that iron has an enduring quality for civilisation as valuable as gold.

## How it began

FMF is a volunteer campaigning group founded in 2019 to save three K6 (made 1935-68) phone kiosks from removal by Britsih telecom (BT) in 2019/20. At this time FMF had a general impression that the kiosks had been made in Falkirk by Carron Company but with no clear understanding of their history, but this was to change. The earliest discovery was a revelation: Found buried in the BT/GPO archives was that Carron Co. won the first ever GPO tender to supply 500 K2 phone kiosks - the PO archives first mention this on 15.11.1926, and would be the only foundry to make all four cast iron telephone kiosks, the K2,K4,K6 & K8. The story about the design of the telephone kiosk is well written about, but not the significance of its iron origins and its public role. Knowing more of what happened now, FMF argue that Falkirk can make a good case to have had a leading role in the success of a world famous design and public service icon.

It was also discovered that another Falkirk area foundry had won a K6 contract: McDowall Steven & Co. 1834-1964, then based at the Castlelaurie foundry, in Bankside, - 1 mile from Carron Co. in Stenhouse Rd - won a GPO contract for 500 K6s c1950. Of the five known foundries that won contracts four were based in a 30 mile radius of central Scotland; Along with Carron Co. & McDowall Steven was Walter MacFarlane's Saracen foundry, 1850-1965, of Possillpark, North Glasgow and The Lion foundry in Kirkintilloch 1880-1983. Both MacFarlane's and Lion were heavily dependent on Ironheart trained foundry workers. The Lion Foundry was founded by three ex-MacFarlane employeesc1880, one of whom Robert Hudson (1844-1912) learned ironfounding at the Abbots Foundry in Falkirk. 
The exception was the 500 made by the Warrington based Bratt Colbran company 1909-c1960. Additionally, it is an Ironheart legend that Comelybank foundry, in Broad St, Denny, made a batch of K6s in the 1980s for pre-privatised British telecom (BT).

![Post box image x3postboxes](postboxesx3)

The BT & PO story continued in Ironheart because the Comelybank foundry became the workshop of Machan Engineering who bought 500 phone kiosks from BT for resale in the 1980s. Selling restored examples to Tom Jones & Elton John. They also continued the Post Office/Royal mail contract for cast iron lamp, wall and pillar post boxes which they made c2004-2016. 
The Ironheart foundries were the main maker's of post boxes: McDowall Steven & Co. won a contract in 1904 - whilst moving from Milton in Port Dundas, Glasgow to Lauireston in Falkirk - continued by Allied Ironfounders (AI) until 1969. According to JY Farrugia's book The Letter Box, 1969, Carron Co won its first pillar box contract in 1922 and continued making boxes until closure in 1982, when Andrew Mathieson of the Engineering Dept at Carron Co. continued the contract under the name 'Carronade Engineering' until c1996. Robert Taylor's Larbert foundry made them for him and continued the contract from 1996 until its closure in 2004, which is when Machan Engineering took over as it would turn out the last maker of cast iron post boxes. Although not a working foundry, Machan's - also an ex Carron Co. foundry manager Bill McMullen - had boxes cast locally at Specialised Castings in Denny, and Ballantine Castings in Bo'ness. Machan's also made replica Victorian era 'Penfold' pillar boxes for the Post Office/Royal Mail which were installed at heritage sites, see image. The end of the post box connection came in 2016, the loss of the post box contract sadly also led to the closure of Machan's. Royal Mail still install letter boxes but they are made of steel and other materials.

Two of the other main suppliers of large letter boxes had Ironheart links. Andrew Handyside of Derby made the new shape round pillar letterboxes from 1879 and overlapped with the others until close c1930. Handyside's mother Margaret Baird was of an Ironheart engineering and foundry family, her brother Charles C1766-1843) worked for Carron Co and employed Andrew to help him build foundries and steam engines in Russia. Another brother, Hugh 1770-1827), designed the Union canal. A canal with no locks between Edinburgh and Falkirk and linked Edinburgh to Glasgow.  The Lion foundry, is in Kirkintilloch, some 20 miles due west of Falkirk (MacFarlane's Saracen foundry in Possilpark is another 11 miles west), gained its first GPO contract in 1936 and other contracts until closure in 1983. It was established by a partnership trio which included Robert Hudson, a Falkirk trained ironfounder.

## Documenting the regeneration of the Ironheart K6s

Informed by this new realisation of the Falkirk area's iron significance, FMF working in collaboration with the local Council saved three K6 kiosks. As their original function as a public pay phone call box is redundant new purposes had to be considered. Because of Carron's Co. solid role in their history, they are now repurposed as Ironheart Time Kiosks, celebrating the many achievements of the Falkirk's area's Iron Industry with graphic displays to stimulate interest in how the innovative foundry products improved public health. 

FMF have now installed a K6 at Carron Works by the West Carron entrance alonside the famous Grahamston cast iron gate archway c1886. Thanks to a financial award from Falkirk council's Community Choices Scheme and the support of Carron Phoenix Franke. It has a display which illustrates many of the achievemnts of Carron Co. For info, see new Projects in the final chapter.

The early campaigns of FMF were mainly about saving as many as possible of the cast iron phone kiosks in the Falkirk Council area at Dunmore, Head of Muir, Denny, Bo'ness, Dawson Park, Ladysmill, Callendar Park & King St., Stenhousemuir. However other engineering related matter were of concern, e.g. the poor condition of the Ladysmill Rail bridge, and the apparent neglect of other iron related history including: The Carron Co. works clock tower; the Carron Co made Bruce Obelisk c1785, and Sun Foundry made iron grave memorials, c1860-90, in Larbert Old Church kirkyard; a suitable display site for the bust of Harriette Gibson 1835-1919, lead campaigner for Falkirk's first general hospital, in 1889, also ironfounder and mother of Sir Robert of Lux Foundry Melbourne and William Gibson Salton Foundry and Burgh Engineer c1912-36.  The rail bridge was an eyesore which only added to the general feeling of neglect around the area where the Ladysmill K6 was located. Network Rail Scotland did respond to our requests and undertook renovation of the bridge in 2020-21, which transformed the area. Now FMF could tackle its own regeneration of the Ladysmill K6. However, at the same time, the other K6s had each a story: The Bo'ness K6, Lion Foundry made, is in a conservation area and a listed so in theory a protected building, but was in poor repair, with Falkirk Council's conservation officer's encouragement, BT did repair and repaint this Kiosk. The Carron Co. made Dunmore K6 was also in a conservation area and the local community council took an interest in its protection. BT decided to retain the Head of Muir K6 (Lion foundry made). The Denny K6, Lion foundry made, is in the care of the Heartbeat Trust, but yet to be renovated. The Carron Co. Dawson park K6 was adopted by the Bainsford War Memorial Association, now in care of the Friends of Dawson Park. This K6 is but a few hundred metres from its place of origin, Carron Co's Mungal foundry, as well as being sited in a park which was originally Carron Co. property. Falkirk Council adopted under the £1 BT scheme three of the remaining K6s: Ladysmill, King St. & Callendar Park to be used by FMF.

## Image of Ladysmill K6 prior to regeneration

The Ladysmill K6 was first regernation project, by FMF, in March April 2022. Fortunately, the kiosk windows had been considerately replaced by BT just before adoption, so our main concern was with cleaning it, some minor repairs, some painting and installing a relevant graphic display which informed the public about the area from an iron perspective. These included the bridge maker MacLellan's who also made the railroad approaches to the Forth bridge, c1889, who also are involved in the origin of the Barr's soft drink Iron Bru, a Falkirk origin company, the images of athletes are from early Irn Bru designs: Thir history claims the drink was first made for the workers building Central Railway Station in Glasgow, which was built by MacLellans. The other forgotten local history element was that the first general public hospital opened in 1889 in the area and the K6 had also provided a public health role by providing access to the 999 emergency service. The figure is based on a thank you drawing in a letter sent by WW1 Trooper Arthur Sykes, he recuperated from his war wounds at Falkirk Infirmary. The other image is of the Forth Raod Bridge, 1964, designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott who also designed the K2, K3 and K6 phone kiosks. Outlines of iron related buildings complete the design: from left, Carron Co blast furnaces c1920, Falkirk Infirmary buildings, Carron Co clock tower and the Grahamston Arch. These interconnected subjects were used as the basis of original drawings by Richard Duffy, the Carron Co phoenix arises from the crowns with a 'Can Do' attittude.

The artwork on the Ladysmill K6 Leaflet can be seen on the leaflet also designed by Richard.

The next regeneration was the King St. Stenhousemuir K6 renamed The Tryst K6, to celebrate the role the area had as a cattle market. The opportunity to work with a local school led to some art students at Larbert High School preparing artwork for display on one side of the K6, images concerned with the Bruce Obelisk and Larbert made cooking stoves and cookers. The other two sides were

1. Doorpanel illustrations intriducing the subject of the Ironhearts of Irontown story including: Kasey the K6, Lettie the letter box, Soapy the bathtub, Rusty the radiator, Trilby the kitchen range and Watty the frypan. A parallel universe fantasy where they are brought to life and return to Ironheart to seek a new purpose. This storybook is available to order, see last page. 
2. Celebrating Stenhousemuir related ironfounders: George Sheriff, although ex Carron Co, who started Dalderse Foundry, 1804-1810, the first foundry in Falkirk to compete with Carron Co; Andrew Matheson whose company Carronade Engineering continued the Ironheart tradition of making letter boxes after Carron Co closed in 1982; George Pate manager of Carron Co 1912-44, whose canny tenders won the company GPO work letterboxes in 1922 and then won the first competitive tender to supply 500 K2s for London in 1926. 
3. Larbert high School art students images of The unrestored Carron Co Bruce Obelisk, c1785, - Falkirk's Taj Mahal - and pop art versions of local cast iron products.

The Tryst K6 was hit by a car in December 2022, only the wooden door was smashed but the driver did not contact FMF. A temporary repair was made and a funding is being sought to restore the kiosk. Donations or offers of help welcome, see contact info on final page.

![Callendar Park K6 pre-adoption condition with damaged door](TrystK6June23)

The K6 adjacent to Paterson tower shop in Callendar Park was renamed the Antonine K6 because it sits on the Roman wall. It had a wind damaged broken door frame which was patched up, and the first display was made by an school art group at Graeme High School, on display for a year. This charming artwork eventually suffered from sun fading and weather damage. It was replaced in 2023 with a new more weatherproof perspex type graphic display created out of photographs of iron related locations in the area, plus two verssons of the newly created Ironheart Trail maps. The locations included the Carron works clock tower, The Smith & Wellstood office blaock in Bonnybridge; the Cruiksjhanks foundry office block in Denny; Comelybank Foundry in Denny, William Gibson Council flats in Main St, Bainsford; The Allied Ironfounders office block in Graham's Rd & the Robert Burns wall medallion in Falkirk High St, made by Grahamston Foundry 1889.

The costs for the renovation of the three adopted K6s were supported by Falkirk Council Community Schools Award, the Falkirk Great Place scheme and other FMF fund raising. Solid assistance also came from a local company, Carron Phoenix, which had its origins in the Carron Co. sink making division. Basic repairs and painting were carried out by FMF volunteers.

Most Phone kiosks will have its maker's marks either inside or on the rear: 'Carron Co. Stirlingshire', or post 1975 Council reorganisation, on K8s and letterboxes, Stirlingshire is changed to 'Falkirk', & marked internally 'CCA'; Walter Macfarlane's Saracen foundry Glasgow, 'MFA'; The Lion foundry Kirkintilloch, 'LFA'. McDowall steven, London & Falkirk has an external badge but internal marks unknown. Bratt Colbran's marks are not known.

Research is ongoing but thus far revealed that Carron Co. won the first GPO phone kiosks tender in late 1926, for 500 Number K2 cast iron kiosks only for installation in London. They would supply all four types of cast iron phone kiosks: 1000 approx x K2s 1927-34, 50 x K4s  1930-5, 50,000 x K6s 1935-68 & 5,000 x K8s 1968-1982. It is an odd fact that the majority of cast iron phone kioks, 80,000 approx , were made by four foundries in central Scotland, including the Lion foundry Kirkintilloch, Macfarlane's Saracen foundry of Possilpark Nth Glasgow and McDowall Steven & Co. of Falkirk, the exception being 500 K6s made by Bratt Colbrann in Warrington c1945-6. Because so many were made in the Falkirk area enough K6 scrap has been recycled to reused in the making of the Ironheart frypans.
