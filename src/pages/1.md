title: "Ironheart: Iron Is Falkirk's Gold'"
---
The rise of the concept of 'Ironheart' focussed the  activities of Falkirk Made Friends on the realisation that the Falkirk area was an iron treasure trove of achievements, which transformed public health and domestic living conditions. The ambition to make a difference of the early Ironheart foundries is evident in their mottoes: Carron Company's 'Esto Perpetua motto'; 'To Live Forever', and Falkirk Iron Co's 'Ferro Non Auro Mollescere Secula'; 'Iron, not gold, is the great civiliser'. These aspirations influenced an updated motto for FMF: 'Iron Is Falkirk's Gold'. A phrase that should encourage consideration of the idea that cast iron has an enduring quality for civilisation, more valuable than gold.

And now; welcome to the Ironheart website, and I hope an entertaining introduction to the achievements of the Falkirk area foundries. I hope that you are an intrigued participant, and can practically support the website's complimentary aim of fund raising for the campaigns of Falkirk Made Friends, by ordering cast iron artifacts which are made in Scotland using traditional foundry skills: At present, these include: Ironheart cast iron cooking frypans; decorative Cockburn's foundry sales sample bathtubs, and historic external 3d flat back wall plaques, characterful life-size portraits, of the Robert Burns characters, Tam O'Shanter & Souter Johnnie. As part of FMF campaigns, thus far three leaflets have been made, and one storybook history of 'The Ironhearts of Irontown' published by Greensand in 2024. The cast iron artifacts. leaflets and booklet are ways to promote interest in Ironheart, to promote ironfounding, and engage in practical ways to raise funds for campaigns to promote Ironheart.

The website content is drawn from my experiences as FMF secretary, and informed by historical archive research and knowledge gained from discussions with current and former foundry workers. To aid understanding of the complexity and scale of the Falkirk area foundry industry, a new social and cultural context has been shaped, and called'Ironheart'. The name reconnects the significant iron history of the Falkirk area and its approximate geographical position in the centre of the central belt of Scotland. It is also solidifies the association with 'Ironbridge', and the role of the Falkirk area members of Allied Ironfounders in establishing the first museum of iron in Coalbrookdale, 1959. The perennial hope of really learning from history has a chance here; the study of Falkirk area foundries is a positive way of understanding past problem solving; this should help to stimulate interest, educate and inspire others to rise to the challenge of contemporary society, and seek to solve problems in practical ways. Dr Duncan Comrie, FMF Secretary.

This website has the aim of engaging interest in, or heating up, the achievements of 'Ironheart' and stimulating interest in a foundry industry which still has a purpose: The Falkirk Council area has still two working foundries, Drysdale Brothers, in Stenhousemuir and Ballantine Castings in Bo'ness, and many foundry legacy companies, including: Carron Bathrooms, Carron Phoenix Franke, Hescott Engineering, FBS aka Falkirk Brass, Falcon Foodservice Equipment, and Moffat catering Equipment. Further afield stoves and cookers which originated in Ironheart are stile made by Esse in Barnoldswick, Waterford Stanley in Ireland, and the Aga Rangemaster Group in Leamington & Telford. The FMF ironfounder Anders Laing, the third generation of a family foundry, now based in Lochgelly, Fife, was trained in foundry skills at Falkirk College, an enthusiastic supporter of Ironheart, and a leading activist - Vice President at present - in the historic foundry body - the Institute of Cast Metal Engineers.

'Ironheart', is a concept which unites all - some 60+ - local foundries and an incredible variety of solid achievements, and summarised as a contribution to enabling radical new standards in public health, of the, since 1759, over a period of 250 years. Ironheart was a national and International centre of light casting innovation, turning up the heat of innovation for cookers, heating and hot water supply. For example, the cast iron frying pan was one of the earliest products made in the Falkirk area made by Carron Co. from its first cast in 1759. The almost immediate consequence of the opening of Carron Co. was the mass production of affordable cast iron pots and pans, this then led to a search for a better way of using the frypan more efficiently, the poorly heat controlled open fire was then continually improved over many years to achieve the control and efficiency of the modern kitchen cooker.

## Ironheart and Robert Burns

The poet Robert Burns was born the same year as Carron Co., 1759, and he lived in the foundry era in an age of two world changing revolutions the Industrial Revolution, c1760, and the French Revolution of 1789. Burns interacted with it on many occasions and was supported as a poet ploughman at Ellisland Farm by Patrick Miller a financial adviser to Carron Co. At Ellisland he wrote Tam O'Shanter and during the 1890s two of its characters began to appear on external walls up and down Scotland. The maker of these heavy cast iron wall sculptures is unknown at present but they are now another a solid Ironheart way of celebrating the Burns connections. Available by order either hand painted or as bare castings.

## 'Ironheart': What Does It Mean?

Carron Co. was the first Ironheart foundry - one of the first planned modern large scale foundry in the world Industrial Revolution. Because it was an innovative force for new technology, it would be the source of many generations of highly skilled, ambitious and motivated engineers, who would both turn the Falkirk area into a world respected hub of innovative light cast iron products, and also lead, educate and inspire foundry skills throughout the world. In its own origin story Carron Co. recruited its first skilled ironfounders from the hot bed of competition in Coalbrookdale, Shropshire. Carron Co's radical difference was that it took the best skills and expertise to a new level of planning, developing an unthought of scale of mass production they signalled the start of a new ambitious and energetic stage in history, called the Industrial revolution.

Due to its size and Carron Co. became a source of highly skilled and entrepreneurial ironfounders who were recruited by initially Northern European countries to establish iron foundries and other engineering projects (see online article Carron Co. & Eastern Europe by Geoff Bailey of the Falkirk Local History club).

A later and dramatic example of that world wide influence was Sir Robert Gibson 1863-1934, from the Camelon foundry, who continued the Ironheart tradition by making the unusual top burner Lux solid fuel cooker, in Melbourne, Australia. Sir Robert turned up the heat in another way as he also gained public notoriety for his cast iron will power as chairman of the National Bank of Australia during the 1929-34 economic depression. Gibson was criticised, for his independent attitude to public spending, by both politicians and the press, and was a particular favourite subject of cartoonists.

## How it began

FMF is a volunteer campaigning group founded in 2019 to save three K6 (made 1935-68) phone kiosks from removal by British telecom (BT) in 2019/20. At this time FMF had a general impression that the kiosks had been made in Falkirk by Carron Company but with no clear understanding of their history, but this was to change. The earliest discovery was a revelation: Found buried in the British Telecom/General Post Office (Bt/GPO/PO) archives was that Carron Co. won the first ever GPO competitive tender to supply 500 K2 phone kiosks - the PO archives first mention this on 15.11.1926, and would be the only foundry to make all four cast iron telephone kiosks, the K2, K4, K6 & K8. The story about the design of the telephone kiosk is well written about, but not the story of its iron origins and development, its makers and its public role. Knowing more of what happened now, FMF argue that Falkirk can make a good case to have had a leading role in the success of a world famous design and public service icon.

Research is ongoing but thus far revealed that Carron Co. won the first GPO phone kiosks tender in late 1926, for 500 Number K2 cast iron kiosks only for installation in London. They would supply all four types of cast iron phone kiosks: 1000 approx x K2s 1927-34, 50 x K4s  1930-5, 50,000 x K6s 1935-68 & 5,000 x K8s 1968-1982. It is an odd fact that the majority of cast iron phone kiosks, 80,000 approx , were made by four foundries in central Scotland, including the Lion foundry Kirkintilloch, Macfarlane's Saracen foundry of Possilpark Nth Glasgow and McDowall Steven & Co. of Falkirk, the exception being 500 K6s made by Bratt Colbran in Warrington c1945-6.

Carron Co. also made other types of kiosk such as police boxes. From the 1930s Carron supplied Edinburgh City Council with a cast iron phone kiosk based on the Council's design of a mini Greek Temple. Many of these are still present in the City, often adapted into coffee stands. The classic Tardis style of police box more commonly seen in big cities was smaller and made in concrete. The Dr Who TV series has given the Tardis a cult following, however the cast iron phone box has attracted much celebrity interest, including David Bowie, Elton John and Tom Jones.

![Edinburgh City Police Box](CarronCoEdinburghpolicebox)

It was also discovered that another Falkirk area foundry had won a K6 contract: McDowall Steven & Co. 1834-1964, then based at the Castlelaurie foundry, in Bankside, - one mile from Carron Co. in Stenhouse Rd - won a GPO contract for 500 K6s, date unknown yet. Of the five known foundries that won contracts four were based in a 30 mile radius of central Scotland; Along with Carron Co. and McDowall Steven was the Glasgow foundry Walter MacFarlane's Saracen foundry, 1850-1965, of Possillpark, and The Lion foundry based in Kirkintilloch 1880-1983. Both MacFarlane's and Lion were heavily dependent on Ironheart trained foundry workers. The Lion Foundry was founded by three ex-MacFarlane employees c1880, one of whom Robert Hudson (1844-1912) Falkirk born, learned ironfounding at the Abbots Foundry in Falkirk.

![Fed Foundry badge](FedFoundriesbadge "R")

The exception was the 500, made c1945, by the Warrington based Bratt Colbran company 1909-c1960. Additionally, it is an Ironheart legend that Comelybank foundry, in Broad St, Denny, made a batch of K6s in the 1980s for pre-privatised British telecom (BT). Some 80,000 cast iron phone kiosk were sited across the British isles. They are gradually growing less present as BT removes them. Many have ended up in private ownership or have been adopted form BT and adapted for other public uses including, village libraries and holding defibrillator equipment.

![Post box image x3postboxes](postboxesx3)

The BT & PO story continued in Ironheart because the Comelybank foundry became the workshop of Machan Engineering who bought 500 phone kiosks from BT for resale in the 1980s. Selling restored examples to Tom Jones & Elton John. They also continued the Post Office/Royal mail contract for cast iron lamp, wall and pillar post boxes which they made c2004-2016.

The Ironheart foundries were the main maker's of post boxes, firstly with McDowall Steven & Co. who won a contract in 1904 - a significant date as it was the year this foundry moved from Milton in Port Dundas, Glasgow, to Laurieston in Falkirk - tapping into local foundry cooker light casting expertise, and also a transfer from using canal to railway for goods transportation. This foundry joined Allied Ironfounders (AI) in 1929 who would continue making lamp and wall letter boxes until 1969.. According to JY Farrugia's well researched book, 'The Letter Box', published 1969, Carron Co. won its first pillar box contract in 1922. Carron Co. appears to have ahd continuous PO contracts, making boxes until closure in 1982.  Fatefully, Andrew Mathieson of the Engineering Dept at Carron Co. continued the contract under the name 'Carronade Engineering' until c1996. These were made by Robert Taylor's Larbert foundry, and when Andrew was forced to retire, continued the contract from 1996 until its own closure in 2004. Then Machan Engineering took over/won the contracts, as it would turn out, the last maker of cast iron post boxes. Although not a working foundry, Machan's - also with an ex Carron Co. foundry manager, Bill McMullen - had boxes cast locally at Specialised Castings in Denny, and Ballantine Castings in Bo'ness. Machan's also made replica Victorian era 'Penfold' pillar boxes for the Post Office/Royal Mail which were installed at heritage sites. The end of the post box connection came in 2016, the loss of the post box contract sadly also led to the closure of Machan's. Royal Mail still install letter boxes but they are made of steel and other materials. Second-hand Letter boxes have been collectables for many years and attract high prices

![Grahamston badge](GindiamondGrahamston "R")

Two of the other main suppliers of large letter boxes had Ironheart links, Handysides and Lion: Andrew Handyside of Derby made the new shape round pillar letterboxes from 1879 - this replaced the Penfold style - and overlapped with the others, until closing c1930. The link is that Handyside's mother, Margaret Baird, was of an Ironheart engineering and foundry family, her brother Charles (C1766-1843) worked for Carron Co. and employed Andrew to help him build foundries and steam engines in Russia. Another brother, Hugh (1770-1827), designed the Union canal which completed the canal link between Glasgow and Edinburgh; an innovative engineering marvel as it was a canal with no locks between Edinburgh and Falkirk. The Bothkennnar bred Baird and Handyside families would play a significant role in iron innovation in the railways and shipping.  The Lion foundry, in Kirkintilloch, is only 20 miles due west of falkirk on the Forth&Clyde Canal. It was led by Robert Hudson and Ironheart trained ironfounder. (MacFarlane's Saracen foundry in Possilpark is another 11 miles west). The Lion foundry gained its first GPO letter box contract in 1936 and other many other PO contracts, including K6 & K8 phone kiosks, until closure in 1983.

Pictured is an original Penfold style letter box (designed by JW Penfold) outside St John's College, Cambridge. This original version was made by Cochrane & Co. of Dudley, a hexagonal style installed 1866-1879, and made by the Cochrane, Grove & Co. Foundry in Dudley.

## Documenting the regeneration of the Ironheart K6s

Informed by this new realisation of the Falkirk area's iron significance, FMF working in collaboration with the local Council saved three K6 kiosks. As their original function as a public pay phone call box is redundant, a new purpose for them had to be found. Because of Carron's Co. solid role in their history, they are now repurposed as Ironheart Time Kiosks, celebrating the many achievements of the Falkirk's area's Iron Industry with graphic displays to stimulate interest in how the innovative foundry products improved public health.

FMF have now installed a K6 at Carron Works by the West Carron entrance alongside the famous Grahamston cast iron gate archway c1886. Thanks to a financial award from Falkirk council's Community Choices Scheme and the support of Carron Phoenix Franke. It has a display which illustrates many of the achievements of Carron Co. For info, see new Projects in the final chapter.

The early campaigns of FMF were mainly about saving as many as possible of the cast iron phone kiosks in the Falkirk Council area at Dunmore, Head of Muir, Denny, Bo'ness, Dawson Park, Ladysmill, Callendar Park & King St., Stenhousemuir. However other engineering related matter were of concern, e.g. the poor condition of the Ladysmill Rail bridge, and the apparent neglect of other iron related history including: The Carron Co. works clock tower; the Carron Co. made Bruce Obelisk c1785, and Sun Foundry made iron grave memorials, c1860-90, in Larbert Old Church kirkyard; a suitable display site for the bust of Harriette Gibson 1835-1919, lead campaigner for Falkirk's first general hospital, in 1889, also ironfounder and mother of Sir Robert of Lux Foundry Melbourne and William Gibson Salton Foundry and Burgh Engineer c1912-36.  The rail bridge was an eyesore which only added to the general feeling of neglect around the area where the Ladysmill K6 was located. Network Rail Scotland did respond to our requests and undertook renovation of the bridge in 2020-21, which transformed the area. Now FMF could tackle its own regeneration of the Ladysmill K6. However, at the same time, the other K6s had each a story: The Bo'ness K6, Lion Foundry made, is in a conservation area and a listed so in theory a protected building, but was in poor repair, with Falkirk Council's conservation officer's encouragement, BT did repair and repaint this Kiosk. The Carron Co. made Dunmore K6 was also in a conservation area and the local community council took an interest in its protection. BT decided to retain the Head of Muir K6 (Lion foundry made). The Denny K6, Lion foundry made, is in the care of the Heartbeat Trust, but yet to be renovated. The Carron Co. Dawson park K6 was adopted by the Bainsford War Memorial Association, now in care of the Friends of Dawson Park. This K6 is but a few hundred metres from its place of origin, Carron Co's Mungal foundry, as well as being sited in a park which was originally Carron Co. property. Falkirk Council adopted under the £1 BT scheme three of the remaining K6s: Ladysmill, King St. & Callendar Park to be used by FMF.

## Image of Ladysmill K6 prior to regeneration

The Ladysmill K6 was first regeneration project, by FMF, in March April 2022. Fortunately, the kiosk windows had been considerately replaced by BT just before adoption, so our main concern was with cleaning it, some minor repairs, some painting and installing a relevant graphic display which informed the public about the area from an iron perspective. These included the bridge maker MacLellan's who also made the railroad approaches to the Forth bridge, c1889, who also are involved in the origin of the Barr's soft drink Iron Bru, a Falkirk origin company, the images of athletes are from early Irn Bru designs: Their history claims the drink was first made for the workers building Central Railway Station in Glasgow, which was built by MacLellans. The other forgotten local history element was that the first general public hospital opened in 1889 in the area and the K6 had also provided a public health role by providing access to the 999 emergency service. The figure is based on a thank you drawing in a letter sent by WW1 Trooper Arthur Sykes, he recuperated from his war wounds at Falkirk Infirmary. The other image is of the Forth Road Bridge, 1964, designed by Sir Giles Gilbert Scott who also designed the K2, K3 and K6 phone kiosks. Outlines of iron related buildings complete the design: from left, Carron Co. blast furnaces c1920, Falkirk Infirmary buildings, Carron Co. clock tower and the Grahamston Arch. These interconnected subjects were used as the basis of original drawings by Richard Duffy, the Carron Co. phoenix arises from the crowns with a 'Can Do' attitude.

The artwork on the Ladysmill K6 Leaflet can be seen on the leaflet also designed by Richard.

The next regeneration was the King St. Stenhousemuir K6 renamed The Tryst K6, to celebrate the role the area had as a cattle market. The opportunity to work with a local school led to some art students at Larbert High School preparing artwork for display on one side of the K6, images concerned with the Bruce Obelisk and Larbert made cooking stoves and cookers. The other two sides were

1. Door panel illustrations introducing the subject of the Ironhearts of Irontown story including: Kasey the K6, Lettie the letter box, Soapy the bathtub, Rusty the radiator, Trilby the kitchen range and Watty the frypan. A parallel universe fantasy where they are brought to life and return to Ironheart to seek a new purpose. This storybook is available to order, see last page.
2. Celebrating Stenhousemuir related ironfounders: George Sheriff, although ex Carron Co., who started Dalderse Foundry, 1804-1810, the first foundry in Falkirk to compete with Carron Co.; Andrew Matheson whose company Carronade Engineering continued the Ironheart tradition of making letter boxes after Carron Co. closed in 1982; George Pate manager of Carron Co. 1912-44, whose canny tenders won the company GPO work letterboxes in 1922 and then won the first competitive tender to supply 500 K2s for London in 1926.
3. Larbert high School art students images of The unrestored Carron Co. Bruce Obelisk, c1785, - Falkirk's Taj Mahal - and pop art versions of local cast iron products.

![Tryst K6 with Richard Duffy, the Ironhearts story artwork artist](TrystK6-with-Duffy)

The Tryst K6 was hit by a car in December 2022, only the wooden door was smashed but the driver did not contact FMF. A temporary repair was made and a funding is being sought to restore the kiosk. Donations or offers of help welcome, see contact info on final page.

![Tryst K6 with smashed door under repair](TrystK6damage22 "R")

![Callendar Park K6 pre-adoption condition with damaged door](TrystK6June23 "L")

The K6 adjacent to Paterson tower shop in Callendar Park was renamed the Antonine K6 because it sits on the Roman wall. It had a wind damaged broken door frame which was patched up, and the first display was made by an school art group at Graeme High School, on display for a year. This charming artwork eventually suffered from sun fading and weather damage. It was replaced in 2023 with a new more weatherproof perspex type graphic display created out of photographs of iron related locations in the area, plus two versions of the newly created Ironheart Trail maps. The locations included the Carron works clock tower, The Smith & Wellstood office black in Bonnybridge; the Cruikshanks foundry office block in Denny; Comelybank Foundry in Denny, William Gibson Council flats in Main St, Bainsford; The Allied Ironfounders office block in Graham's Rd & the Robert Burns wall medallion in Falkirk High St, made by Grahamston Foundry 1889.

![Callander Park, aka Antonine, K6 with Graeme High School artwork display](Antonine-GraemeHS-2021)

The costs for the renovation of the three adopted K6s were supported by Falkirk Council Community Schools Award, the Falkirk Great Place scheme and other FMF fund raising. Solid assistance also came from a local company, Carron Phoenix, which had its origins in the Carron Co. sink making division. Basic repairs and painting were carried out by FMF volunteers.

Most Phone kiosks will have its maker's marks either inside or on the rear: 'Carron Co. Stirlingshire', or post 1975 Council reorganisation, on K8s and letterboxes, Stirlingshire is changed to 'Falkirk', & marked internally 'CCA'; Walter Macfarlane's Saracen foundry Glasgow, 'MFA'; The Lion foundry Kirkintilloch, 'LFA'. McDowall steven, London & Falkirk has an external badge but internal marks unknown. Bratt Colbran's marks are not known.

The origin of the concept of Ironheart arose as a consequence saving the local K6s. Research on the phone kiosks discovered that Carron Co. were the first GPO tender, which would then lead to a growing realisation that the Falkirk area foundries had a special place in history. Fortunately Falkirk archives are a treasure trove of original foundry documents. The Ironheart story, informed by archive research, continues in the next chapter.
