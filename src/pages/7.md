Latest FMF project is the purchase, and installation of a 1946 K6 at West Carron Works by teh Grahamston Gate.

FMF are working on several projects at present, these include:
A K6 has been recently installed at the west entrance at Carron Works, alongside the Grahamston Arch. This is courtesy of Carron Phoenix Franke and funding from Falkirk Council's Community Choices scheme. The public launch took place on 27th August 2025. The guest speaker was Clare Gibson nee Gibson, who spoke about the links between Carron Coo and her graet grandmother Harriette Gibson. Harriette led a public campaign to fund Falkirks first general hospital, which opened in 1889.

FMF are also conserving for display a recently acquired K6. Made by Carron Co. and marked with the date '35/1' = first part of 1935, which means that it was of the first batch of K6s made by Carron Co. The 'Jubilee' K6 was launched with a royal purpose to celebrate the 25 year anniversary of King George V's reign in 1935. Thus this particular K6 was properly a Jubilee, he was still alive when it was made, George VI died in January 1936. A number of locations in Falkirk are under consideration.
