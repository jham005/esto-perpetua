title: 1.7: FMF Current Projects, research information and contact info
---
FMF are working on several projects at present, these include:
Conserving for display a recently acquired K6. Made by Carron Co and marked with the date '35/1' = first part of 1935, which means that it was of the first batch of K6s made by Carron Co. The 'Jubilee' K6 was launched with a royal purpose to celebrate the 25 year anniversary of King George V's reign in 1935. Thus this particular K6 was properly a Jubilee, he was still alive when it was made Georeg VI died in January 1936. A number of locations are in consultation.

Developing the Ironheart mural iron art display at FBS aka Fakirk Brass in Gowan Avenue continues, several artifacts are being prepared as additions to the display. This is courtesy of FBS and funding from Falkirk Council's Community Choices scheme.

A K6 is in process of being installed at the west entrance at Carrons Works, alongside the Grahamston Arch. This is courtesy of Carron Phoenix Franke and funding from Falkirk Council's Community Choices scheme.

FMF are in negotiations with the current owners of the Carron Co Clock Tower to ensure its long term future as the beating heart of Ironheart.
