title:1.3 Falkirk 1759,  Carron Co Turned Up the Heat of the Modern World with Cast Iron pots and Pans.
---

Arguably the Industrial Revolution began with the mass production of cast iron cookware. Making the Ironheart frypan reconnects with the origin of Carron Company in 1759. The frying pan was one of the earliest products made at this foundry and led a revolution in domestic living standards. A grand claim but one that can be explained by considering the historical context: Before the cast iron pan how did food get cooked? At its most basic food was cooked on an open fire either baked or roasted. No frying or stewing was possible unless you were wealthy enough to own a brass three legged pot - which sat in the fire.  The only other cooking aid was a bakestone, its origin a flat stone warmed by the fire which radiated heat for making flatbreads, pancakes, bannocks and oatcakes. A ingenuous development was the wrought iron version of the bakestone, called a girdle in Scotland, and griddle in Ireland. The reason these were passed down the generations, as heirlooms, was they were labour intensive to make, therefore expensive items.

In Scotland, until the rise of Carron Co., girdle making had been a monopoly of the Culross Hammermen or Smiths confirmed by royal warrant in 1599. For further information see David Beveridge, Culross and Tulliallan, 1885, chXXI or the Electric Scotland website. Although the Culross made wrought iron girdles had a traditional market, they could not compete in price with Carron Co. who could mass produce them fast using moulten iron for fast casting, rather than the labour intensive hammering flat of red hot metal.  Thus from 1759, in Scotland, the wrought iron girdle was supplemented and ultimately replaced by more flexible cooking tool, the cast iron frying pan - although pancakes cooked on a girdle are still a traditional delicacy - because Carron Co. and some other foundries specialised in adapting the potential of cast iron to mass production, which made pots and pans affordable and an everyday item. 'Hollow-ware' was the name adopted for the cast iron pot trade which included kettles and Dutch Ovens, hop pots or casserole dishes. Some of the common names found on old cast iron cookware includes from Ironheart, Carron, Falkirk (Falkirk Iron Co. c1819-1982), Larbert (Dobbie Forbes 1870-1982), Grahamston Iron Co. 1868-1990, Esse by Smith & Wellstood 1858-1992 (Virginia Woolf's home Monk's House has an Esse frypan on display). From the Midlands & Shropshire: Coalbrookdale 1709-2017, who also made AGA pots. The foundries around Wolverhampton & Wednesbury near Birmingham became a major Hollow-ware hub including: Dudley, Holcrofts, A. Kenrick, T&C. Clarke, E. Pugh, J&J. Siddons, T. Sheldon, Crane, Izons & Radaware by the Radiation group etc. By the 1950s These foundries would either discontinue iron or adapt to new methods and materials including: enamel tin plate, aluminium, stainless steel, etc.

The honours for developing engineering innovation is claimed by the Shropshire based Coalbrookdale foundry, from 1709 they were able to use coal as fuel to make cast iron for pot and pan making, but on a limited scale. It was from this foundry that Carron Co. recruited skilled iron founders to start its new ambitious scale of production in Falkirk, and started training local replacements. Thus a revolution began, one thing led to another a frypan led to a better way of heating it which led to the birth of the cast iron cooking range which then became a search for fuel efficiency and the development of controlled heat for hot water and home warming.  

One of the earliest known examples of a cast iron cooking range still celebrated is the one in Robert Burn's farmhouse at Ellisland near Dumfries. This range was bought from Carron works and installed c1890. It was the era of Burns in a dilemma about his future, either the independent farmer and dandy ploughman - see Paisley Burns memorial for that style - or working for the government as an exciseman aka tax collector. His new farmhouse was built with funds supplied by the landowner Patrick Miller, who was closely associated with Carron Co. both as an investment adviser and an inventor. Because of Miller's experience of piracy on the high seas Miller contributed to the design of the Carronade as a defensive weapon; he also commissioned the construction of the first working steam powered paddle ship at Dalswinton Loch in 1788, for which the engine parts were made at Carron Co. It is possible that Miller had some design ideas for kitchen ranges and may have had a hand in the design of the new innovative all cast iron range and oven fitted at Ellisland. Miller was also an agricultural improver - called 'Turnip Miller' - and was disappointed when Burns gave up the farm and moved into Dumfries in 1792. His wife Jean Armour may well have ben sorely tried by the switch from a modern range to cooking on an open fire in teh Dumfries house. The picture is of the present range and oven, but only the oven is likely the original.  A hort playlet prodcuced for the Ironheart Mural Launch and Falkirk Brass FBS open day, in 2022, explored the relationship between Carron Co. and Burns in the context of an era of two major revolutions the Industrial and the French. Two characters, Tam O'Shanter and the Carron Co Phoenix xonsider teh significane of the poem wa sit really an ode to a cooker and domextic comforts?  The amde to order Ironheart cast iron heads of Burn's characters Tam O'Shanter & Souter Johnnie are an additional way of reconnecting Ironheart with Burns in this period, as he wrote Tam O'Shanter whilst living at Ellisland near Dumfries.
Potentially then Robert Burns imagination was fired up by a Carron Co kitchen range, and the radiating effect of cast iron heat cooked up a tasty recipe of fantasy and reality. The Ironheart frypan has teh same potential...
