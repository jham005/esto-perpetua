title: Falkirk 1759, Carron Co. turned up the heat in the modern world with cookers and cast iron pots and pans
---

Arguably, one of the first social consequences of the Industrial Revolution, c1760, was the mass production of affordable cast iron cookware. Making for sale the Ironheart frypan reconnects us today with one of the first products made by Carron Company in 1759, which fed a revolution in domestic living standards. A grand claim, but one that can be explained by considering the historical context: Before the cast iron pan how did food get cooked? At its most basic food was cooked on an open fire either baked or roasted. No frying or stewing was possible unless you were wealthy enough to own a brass three legged pot - which sat in the fire.  The only other cooking aid was a bakestone, its origin a flat stone warmed by the fire which radiated heat for making flatbreads, pancakes, bannocks and oatcakes. A ingenuous development was the wrought iron version of the bakestone, called a girdle in Scotland, and griddle in Ireland. The reason these were passed down the generations, as heirlooms, was they were labour intensive to make, therefore expensive items.

In Scotland, until the rise of Carron Co., girdle making had been a monopoly of the Culross (Fife) Hammermen, or Smiths, confirmed by a royal warrant in 1599. For further information see David Beveridge, Culross and Tulliallan, 1885, chXXI or the Electric Scotland website. Although the Culross made wrought iron girdles had a traditional market, they could not compete in price with Carron Co. who could mass produce them using molten iron for fast casting, rather than the labour intensive hammering flat of red hot wrought iron ingots.  Thus, from 1759, the wrought iron girdle was supplemented and ultimately replaced by a rich variety of cooking tools, including the cast iron frying pan - although pancakes cooked on a girdle are still a traditional delicacy - because Carron Co. and other foundries specialised in adapting the potential of cast iron to mass production, which made pots and pans affordable and an everyday item.  Carron Co. was the first foundry to apply large scale mass production to frypan and pot making thus less labour intensive to make and cheaper to purchase.  

'Hollow-ware' was the name adopted for the cast iron pot trade which included kettles and Dutch Ovens, hotpots or casserole dishes. Some of the common names found on old cast iron cookware includes from Ironheart, Carron, Falkirk (Falkirk Iron Co. c1819-1982), Larbert (Dobbie Forbes 1870-1982), Grahamston Iron Co. 1868-1990, Esse by Smith & Wellstood 1858-1992 (Virginia Woolf's home Monk's House has an Esse frypan on display). The Coalbrookdale foundry 1709-2017, were one the early manuafctures of cast iron pot and pans, and when part of Allied Ironfounders, after 1929, made AGA badged pots pans and other cooker related goods.

Alongside Ironheart foundries, Wolverhampton & Wednesbury, near Birmingham, became a major hub of foundries specialising in Hollow-ware including the companies: Dudley; Holcrofts; A. Kenrick; T&C. Clarke; E. Pugh; J&J. Siddons; T. Sheldon; Swain; Crane; Izons; & Radaware by the Radiation group etc. By the 1950s, these foundries would either discontinue iron, diversify or adapt to new methods and materials including: enamel tin plate, aluminium, stainless steel, etc.

The honours for developing engineering innovation in cast iron is claimed by the Coalbrookdale foundry; from 1707 they patented the green sand moulding technique that would become the foundry standard. In 1709 they also started the development of coal based coke as the main fuel to melt iron ore for use in casting pot and pans. It was from this foundry that Carron Co. recruited skilled iron founders to start its new ambitious scale of production in Falkirk, and started training local replacements. Thus a revolution began in solid fuel technology, one thing led to another; a cast iron frypan needed a better way of heating it, which led to the birth of the cast iron cooking range. This then initiated a search for fuel efficiency and the development of air controlled heat for hot water and home warming, best expressed in insulated heat storage cooker eg The legendary Ironheart products; the Aga, Esse & Rayburn cookers.   

One of the earliest known examples of a cast iron cooking range, is in Robert Burn's farmhouse at Ellisland near Dumfries, now a museum. This range was bought from Carron works and installed c1890. It was the year when Burns was in a dilemma about his future, either to be the independent farmer and dandy ploughman - see Paisley Burns memorial for that style - or working for the government as an exciseman, aka a customs tax collector. The appearance of the Carron Co. cooker in his new farmhouse was most likely due to his patron, the landowner Patrick Miller, who was closely associated with Carron Co. both as an investment adviser and an inventor. Because of Miller's experience of fighting piracy - in that era called 'privateers' - on the high seas, he contributed to the design of the Carronade as a relatively versatile lightweight, powerful, and quick firing defensive weapon; he also commissioned the construction of the first working steam powered paddle ship at Dalswinton Loch in 1788, for which the engine parts were made at Carron Co. It is possible that Miller had some design ideas for kitchen ranges and may have had a hand in the design of the new innovative all cast iron range and oven fitted at Ellisland. Miller was also an agricultural improver - called 'Turnip Miller' - and was disappointed when Burns gave up the farm and moved into Dumfries in 1792. Burns was at his most upset about his new supply of manure, which was the answer to improved crops but he could not take it with him.  Burns wife, Jean Armour, may well have been sorely tried by the switch from a modern range to cooking on an open fire in the Dumfries house. The picture is of the present range and oven, but only the oven is likely the original.  

A short 15minute playlet produced for the Ironheart Mural Launch and Falkirk Brass FBS open day, in 2022, explored the relationship between Carron Co. and Burns in the context of an era of two major revolutions the Industrial and the French. Two characters, Tam O'Shanter and the Carron Co. Phoenix consider the significance of the poem was it really an ode to a cooker and domestic comforts? Performed by Eddie Mackenzie and Sarah Meikle twe Glasgow based actors. Written and directed by D. Comrie. see short video clip of the beginning.

The made to order Ironheart cast iron heads of Burn's characters Tam O'Shanter & Souter Johnnie, are an additional way of reconnecting Ironheart with Burns in this period, as he wrote Tam O'Shanter whilst living at Ellisland near Dumfries.

Potentially, Robert Burns imagination was fired up by heat of a Carron Co. kitchen range. The hot radiating effect of cast iron heat could then have cooked up a tasty recipe of fantasy and reality. The Ironheart frypan could the same potential to fire up the imagination, it could also cook up some tasty stories. 

Next, Chapter 4 examines in more details the international influence of Carron Co., and the evolution of cooking on cast iron cookers in their many forms.
