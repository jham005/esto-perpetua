title: 1.6: Making Ironheart Beat Again: New Cast Iron Products.
---

The romantic ideal of reconnecting in 2021 - when the idea of casting a pan was first discussed - with 1759 by making a cast iron frypan seemed like a solid way of celebrating Ironheart the collective achievements of the Falkirk area foundries and their international significance. A number of factors encouraged further interest: The cast iron frypan can also still be used today, it suits all types of cookers. It has no potentially unpleasant coatings; a patina, a non-stick surface, called seasoning layers of cooking oil built up with use; is also passed down the generations as it never wears out; it can be made from recycled iron.

How hard is it to make a cast iron frypan? Initially it seemed simple just use an old pan as a pattern and get a local foundry to cast it. However the art of making thin castings is a hard won skill. At one time the Falkirk area specialised in what is called light castings, e.g. thin walled cast iron products like pots, pans, kettles, drain pipes, cooking ranges and bathtubs. Finding a foundry who was prepared to spend time re-acquiring this skill was to prove a problem.

I had the advice of two local foundries Ballantine Castings in Bo'ness and Archibald Young's of Kirkintilloch who helped with design problems, which led to John Green's the pattern makers in Clydebank. They were able to help making a pattern using resin, which would make the moulding easier. However it was a chance exchange with Andrew Laing of Laing's foundry, a third generation family foundry now based in Lochgelly, which was the breakthrough. Andrew was enthusiastic to help - Andrew had the critical requiremnts of patience and enthusiasm - but FMF also began learning from him about the different moulding techniques particularly moulding sands: The traditional moulding medium green sand, - as used at Carron Co in 1759 - and the modern use of chemical hard setting sand. liangs use both as each has qualities the other has not.

## Moulding and casting a cast iron frypan

At Laing's foundry the traditional technology of using green sand for moulding the pan is used, the very same technique first developed fully at Coalbrookdale in 1707 and used by Carron Co. when it started in 1759. Green sand is a damp mix of quarried sand with clay and other additives including coal dust. In texture, soft but thick enough to stay firm, a balance which introduces a delicacy of handling into the moulding process; being relatively soft the sand can easily be knocked and detail lost. The art is to encase the pattern in the green sand then to open the two halves of the casting boxes/flasks, remove the pattern and re-join the two halves together without causing any movement in the sand. A pour access gate and exhaust air vent has also to be carved into the sand. Pouring molten iron into the gate requires a steady flow, not to quick or slow. The iron has to be at the optimum temperature, 1600c approx, so it flows all the way round the empty space inside the sand mould. The molten iron can be poured either by hand shank or by a pulley controlled ladle, again a sensitive hand is required. Within thirty minutes the sand mould can be broken and the still hot casting examined. Because they are made by hand, using green sand, every frypan will be slightly different. If chemical resin sand is used a more more consistent finish can be ensured. Why use green sand then? Because its soft it allows finer moulding, but requires highly skilled moulders.

Once the mould is broken open the frypan is revealed, but with odd attachments the gate and exit holes are now evident as they were filled with iron. These have to be broken or ground off. Another job which requires careful handling. On inpsect what is not wanted is large pinprick air holes or gritty parts where loose sand has fallen in. In the days of piecework, payment by results, in the foundries this was always a bone of contention between the moulders and the foremen. If minor faults they would be passed and the moulders would be paid - moulders generally worked in pairs - if not a blame game would ensue, because a faulty casting may have also been the fault of the furnaceman - metallurgy not right or not hot enough - or the fettler made a mistake grinding off any spill etc. As Ironheart frypans are made in small batches of 3 or 4 they do tend to have minor blemishes, but this is acceptable given they are hand made. If the foundry had say an order for 100, the final finish would be more uniform, because of the accumulated moulding experience and it would be possible to switch to hardset sand.

The final accepted pan will next have to be heat tested on a gas burner or heater of similar kind. When heated if it does not emit a painful sharp snapping sound and split, it is ready to be used as a cooking implement. The straight from mould finish on the pan is the traditional finish, but sometimes pans are shot or sand blasted for a more even finish. FMF prefer the as from mould finish as this would have been the way they were made until the arrival of chemical sand. The pan should then be seasoned either by coating in a cooking oil and baked in an oven or just by repeated cooking use. A new frypan has to be run in like a car, gradually increasing the heat and over time the oil patina creates a non-stick cooking surface. Cleaned by hand rinsing. If treated correctly a cast iron frypan will not wear out can be passed onto the next generation, unless they are tempted by the latest fashion in cooking equipment. The only drawbakc of a cast iron frypan is that it is a heavier item. However, this can be overcome by, rather than tipping it, a spooning alternative can be developed.  

## The Next Step: Turning up the Heat more efficiently with The Insulated Heat Storage Cooker

The ironheart frypan is a unique practical historical artifact, still a useful cooking tool with a tried and tested history of achievement. The next thing to do is to get a cast iron heat storage cooker, it also reconnects the traditional cast iron range with modern fuel efficiency. The cast iron range simialr to that used by Robert Burns in the 1790s, was given a revolutionary makeover when in Sweden Gustav Dalen invented the AGA heat storage cooker in 1922. Its innnovation is a bizarre story: The Nobel prize winning engineer/inventor was forced to stay at home by an industrial injury - he was blinded whilst carrying out an experiment with acetylene gas - and noticing how much time his wife spent preparing the kitchen range for cooking he had a revolutionary idea: Insulate the cooker internally to store heat and conserve fuel, and coat the exterior with vitreous enamel to reduce cleaning. Despite his sight loss he was ever the optimist and committed his company AGA (Svenska Akriebolaget Gasaccumulator) to developing his idea and then selling it in Britain. Two Falkirk Iron companies took the challenge seriously: by 1933 Smith & Wellstood, of Bonnybridge, had introduced their own version, the Fairy. As they were more expensive than any other type of cooker, the sales publicity of thsi new insulated cooker was aimed at a new social development, the idea of housewife hostess - which solved the servant problem - and a new concept of the kitchen as the heart of the home. Both the AGA and Fairy offered new standards of cleanliness; all day heat efficiency and were labour saving devices and thus attractive additions to a new idea of the home. Although the AGA and Fairy led innovation they were aimed at the well off, what was needed was a heat storage cooker that was affordable to the general public. Along came the Falkirk led Allied Ironfounders (AI) in 1934 and although initially engaged in a patent dispute with AGA - over their own version the 'Thermecon' - bought them out in 1935 - Dalen was always experimenting, thus short of cash - and took over the UK rights, guaranteeing the success of the AGA yet then developing the Rayburn version. Although delayed by WW2, the AI Rayburn when launched in 1946 was an immediate success and became popular fitting in post-war public housing. The Rayburn's were first made in Falkirk, but AI split the types between there and Coalbrookdale. No1 & 2 Falkirk & Aga boiler and commercial cookers; 3 & 4 & Aga domestic at Coalbrookdale. Glynwed concentrated These cookers somewhat modeified and improved are still in production today, updated with new power sources but essentially the same design because they combine a variety of features not available elsewhere: home heating, water heating, cooking attributes, attractive designs and add traditional comfort of a 24 hour heat source to a home.

This is only a short summary history of the Heat Storage Cooker and what happened in Falkirk, yet it marks a high point of Ironheart achievement and also its demise.

Too Hot To Handle: A cautionary tale of how The success of the AGA caused Allied Ironfounders to think they could start an insulated heat storage cooker revolution in Australia. In an excess of enthusiasm- carried away by the radical new sales advertising promotion campaigns of the AGA AI decided to start manufacturing Aga and Rayburn Cookers in Australia. The origins of this misguided enthusiasm date back to 1936 when AI commissioned a leading market research company to promote the AGA, this as led by David Ogilvy who produced a radical sales booklet 'The theory and Practice of Selling the AGA Cooker'. Although it presented a new cooker vision, David Ogilvy offended the directors of AI and left for America where he became a leading Marketing innovator. However the seed of ambition had been planted and post war it sprouted when AI decided to build a new foundry in Australia to build AGAs and Rayburn cookers. The option of working with Metters an experienced  local cooker foundry was dismissed in preference of going it alone. The leading exponent of this move was the AI director WT Wren, although he enjoyed success directing AGA Heat Ltd his luck was to rou out with this Australian venture. Just as the decision was made the key Australian contact Sir John Storey died, but as well the marked demand for AGAs and Rayburns took a nosedive. However the plan to build the foundry went a head, a site was found in Clayton, a suburb of Melbourne in Victoria. However they could not get experienced staff locally so a recruiting call was put out to AI foundries in the UK. As a house was part of the deal, many employees took the opportunity to move.

Despite bringing in experienced staff the market demand did not improve and the foundry became a money pit so AI closed it in 1959 and the site was sold to Volkswagen. Now part of Monash University campus. Ironically Sir Robert Gibson an earlier émigrée Falkirk ironfounder worked closely with Sir John Monash as commissioners, on the State Electricity Commission of Victoria, building and developing brown coal and hydro powered electricity power stations at Yallourn from c1919. AI was severely weakened by the financial loss and would itself be bought out in 1969 by Glynwed Holdings. AI's Australian misadventure is a sorry tale of believing its own hype; allowing a marketing vision to determine investment. The rise and fall of Allied Ironfounders 1929-69 - forty years of radical visionary foundry products undone by thinking the AGA could heat the world. AI did try and change the world but the Australian misadventure was a step too far and has obscured its many other solid achievements eg, its started the first iron museum at Coalbrookdale in 1959 which has grown into the Ironbridge Gorge Trust.
